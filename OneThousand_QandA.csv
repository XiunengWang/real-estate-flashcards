Real property is said to be more subject to the effects of externalities than most assets. This vulnerability is principally due to:,the relatively high cost of real property.|the fact that land is fixed in supply.|the immobility of land.|the lack of effective government regulations.,"<p>Option (3) is correct because the immobility of land renders real property more subject r eal property to the <br>effects of externalities than most assets . An owner cannot move his or her real property to a more desirable <br>location with beneficial externalities. Similarly, a n owner cannot move his or her property away from a location <br>subject or negative externalities.

"Which of the following is NOT a ""real estate service"" under the Real Estate Services Act?",Constructing a commercial office building in Prince George for an owner who lives in British Columbia|Collecting rents from tenants in a residential building in Burnaby for an owner who lives in Singapore|Selling a Penticton property for an owner who lives in Victoria|Assisting in the sale of a condominium unit located in Vancouver but owned by a person who lives in Calgary,<p>Option (1) is correct because construction of a building  is not a real estate service under the Real Estate Services <br>Act. Option (2) is incorrect because collecting rents from tenants is defined as “ rental property management <br>services ” which fall under “ real estate services ” in the Real Estate Services Act . Options (3) and (4) are incorrect <br>because selling or assisting in the sale of properties is defined as “ trading services ” which fall under “ real estate <br>services ” in the Real Estate Services Act .</p>,Correct Option: 1,3
"Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations?","Only sole proprietors need to report business income on their personal income tax returns.|Only partners of a partnership need to report business income on their personal tax returns.|Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations are identical in terms of taxation of owner's income.|A corporation is a separate legal entity with its own income tax status.",<p>Option (4) is correct; corporations are subject to income tax as a separate legal entity. Options (1) and (2) are <br>incorrect  because both sole proprietors and partners need to report their business income on their personal <br>income tax re turns. Option (3) is incorrect  because corporations have different tax liability from proprietors <br>and partners in that corporations are taxed as a separate legal entity.</p>,Correct Option: 4,4
Consider a situation in which the principal is the seller and the agent is the listing agent. Which of the following events will terminate the real estate agency relationship?,The principal's refusal to accept an offer to purchase presented by the agent where the offer exactly complies with the requirements in the listing contract|An act of the principal that is inconsistent with the continuation of the agent's authority|An offer by the agent to personally purchase the principal's property|The revocation of an offer to purchase by the offeror before the principal can accept it,"<p>Option (2) is correct because a  real estate agency relationship depends on mutual consent, and therefore either <br>party can terminate the relationship at will. An agent’s authority can be revoked orally or by conduct, and an <br>act of the principal that is inconsistent with the continuation of authority terminate s the relat ionship. Options  <br>(1) and (4) are incorrect because these scenarios do not terminate the agency relationship. They relate  to the  <br>principal’s  duty to pay real estate commission to the agent . Option  (3) is incorrect  because a n agent’s offer to <br>personally purc hase the principal’s property  is a conflict of interest. While such conflicts should be avoided, <br>they do not terminate  the agency relationship .   <br></p>",Correct Option: 2,5

"Before adopting, amending, or repealing a zoning bylaw, a municipal council as a matter of policy will:",obtain the approval of the federal government.|obtain the approval of the provincial government.|give three months' written notice to the public.|hold a public hearing.,"<p>Option (4) is correct because a municipal council will hold a public hearing before adopting, amending or <br>repealing a bylaw.  Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because the power to zone has been delegated to the <br>municipality by the Province, and the Province has not retained the right to decide zoning matters. Option (3) is <br>incorrect  because a municipal council  typically issues notice of a public hearing to neighbouring properties, <br>but no specified written notice is required.</p>",Correct Option: 4,7
Which of the following might be the subject of a real property appraisal?,Air space rights|A life insurance policy|A diamond|A home owner's insurance policy,"<p>Option (1) is correct because the subject of a real property appraisal  is the particular rights of ownership vested <br>in a certain piece of real estate.

"The principle that the person named on a particular certificate of title is entitled to a fee simple interest in that property, free from any condition or encumbrance that is not shown on title, is known as the:",assurance principle.|entitlement principle.|fee simple principle.|indefeasibility principle.,"<p>Option (4) is correct and (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the principle of indefeasibility means that if a <br>person is named on a certificate of title as the owner of the fee simple estate in land, then that is conclusive proof, as far as the world is concerned, that he or she is entitled to that fee simple estate.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 4,10
"In the event that the tenant abandons a commercial premises, the landlord is best advised to notify the tenant that the landlord intends to enter into possession of the premises solely to re-let on the tenant's account:",or else the doctrine of frustration will be applied to the situation.|to avoid the tenant having grounds for an action in trespass.|so that all of the landlord's rights against the tenant will be preserved.|because otherwise the landlord will be breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment.,"<p>Option (3) is correct because if the landlord notifies the tenant of entry to re -let the premises, he will not lose  his <br>rights against the tenant. Option (1) is incorrect because the doctrine of frustration only applies when events <br>outside of the control of the parties fundamentally change the subject matter of the contract. In this case, an <br>abandonment of comm ercial premises would not frustrate  the contract. Option (2) is incorrect because  even if <br>the landlord did not provide notice,  the tenant would not have grounds for an action in trespass , as the <br>landlord has a right to enter incidental to the right to levy a distress. Option (4) is incorrect because the <br>covenant of quiet enjoyment protects the tenant’s right to the premises. Here, the tenant has abandoned the <br>premises and the landlord would not be breaching the covenant by entering the premises.</p>",Correct Option: 3,11
Which of the following elements are NOT considered in determining appropriate rates of interest on mortgage loans?,The credit rating of the borrower|The type of property used for security|The amount of administrative attention required on the loan|The amount of property insurance,"<p>Option (4) is correct because t he amount of property insurance does not affect the risk to the lender, and <br>therefore will not be considered in determining the appropriate rate. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because <br>the borrower ’s credit rati ng and the type of property affect the risk of the loan to the lender. Option (3) is <br>incorrect because a  lender will set an appropriate rate of return based on the risk of lending, as well as the <br>amount of administrative work required.</p>",Correct Option: 4,12
"Where a commercial tenancy is expressed as lasting for a period of one year and terminating on a fixed date, how much notice must be given to terminate the tenancy?",No notice is required.|Thirty days' notice is required.|Six months' notice is required.|Reasonable notice is required.,"<p>Option (1) is correct because a commercial lea se for a fixed term terminates  at the end of the term, on the <br>specified end date.

"Which of the following is NOT a possible meaning of the term ""common law""?",The law created by the courts as opposed to statute law|The principles derived from the common law courts in England as opposed to the principles derived from the courts of Chancery|The laws created by the Federal government in accordance with its power under the Constitution|The system of law which relies upon the principle of stare decisis for its development,"<p>Option (3) is the correct answer because it is not a possible meaning of the term “common law”. The body of <br>laws created by the Federal government (i.e., by the federal legislature) is referred to as statute law. Option (1) is <br>incorrect because the term “common law” often broadly refers to the law created by the courts, based in either <br>common -law or equitable principles . Option (2) is incorrect because another possible meaning  of “common <br>law”  is the original set of court -developed principles , which evolved separately from equitable principles , before <br>these two courts merged . Option  (4) is incorrect because the doctrine of stare decisis  underlies the binding <br>nature of precedent within the common law.</p>",Correct Option: 3,14

Separate consideration needs to be given to create an option <br>agreement and keep the offer open.  Option (1 ) is incorrect  because  it is true – revocation of an offer can happen <br>at any time prior to the ex piration of the offer. Option (3) is  incorrect  because any changes that Harvey makes to <br>the offer would be considered a counter -offer . A counter -offer must be accepted by Mary, so it effectively <br>terminates her original offer. Option (4) is incorrect  because revocation must actually be communicated to <br>Harvey.

"Zelda was in a good mood one day, and she went over to her next door neighbour Herb's house and cleaned all his gutters. When Herb returned home from work, he was thrilled by what Zelda had done and he said, ""Zelda, I am going to give you a case of wine for doing this."" Weeks passed, and finally Zelda asked Herb when she could expect to receive her wine. Herb said that he had changed his mind. Zelda is now furious and wants to sue Herb in small claims court for a breach of contract. Which of the following statements is most relevant to these facts?","An invitation to treat is distinguishable from an offer because it cannot form a binding contract, if accepted.|A voidable contract exists until it is repudiated by the party entitled to do so.|Past consideration is no consideration.|Breach of a condition of a contract entitles the injured party to terminate the contract.","<p>Option (3) is  relevant  and therefore correct  because although Herb offered a case of wine as present <br>consideration, the cleaning of the gutters was past consideration . Since past consideration is no consideration, <br>no contract formed  between Herb and Zelda . Option (1) is incorrect because an invitation to tre at is typically an <br>advertisement or other statement from one party inviting another party to make a legal offer. No invitation to <br>treat appears in this scenario . Option (2) is  incorrect because there is  no voidable contract to be repudiated on <br>the facts.

Option (1) is incorrect because the objectivity principle states that all <br>values must be objective and verifiable. Option (2) is incorrect because the consistency principle states that once <br>a company adopts a certain accounting policy, they should continue to use that same policy.

For example, a licensee acting for a seller could be held liable for <br>negligent misrepresentation for a statement made to a  buyer despite having no contractual relationship with <br>the buyer.  Option (2) is incorrect because the statement made may be fact or opinion as the representative is a <br>skilled person and the other party may reasonably rely on it. Option (3) is incorrect bec ause there is a <br>requirement of reliance on the statement and resulting damage from that reliance to establish a claim of <br>negligent misrepresentation.

Mary and John own a piece of real property as joint tenants.

The unity of interest requires that all joint tenants have <br>the same estate or interest in land; the extent, nature, and duration must be identical. Option (1) is  incorrect i n <br>certain scenarios, a joi nt tenancy can be severed by one of the joint tenants even if the other joint tenant(s) is <br>unaware of the action of the joint tenant severing the joint tenancy. Option (2) is  incorrect because i n a joint <br>tenancy, the co -owners each have an undivided share in the property. By definition, joint tenants are co -owners <br>of the same interest, whatever that interest may be. Finally, Option (3) is incorrect because a  defining feature of <br>joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. This means that when one joint tenan t dies, that joint tenant’s estate <br>automatically vests in the surviving joint tenant(s).</p>",Correct Option: 4,90

Options (1) and (2) are incorrect <br>because t hese types of heating systems are advantageous in that  they also provide air filtration and have a fast <br>response time to temperature changes. Option (4) is incorrect because these types of heating systems transmit <br>heat through convection.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 3,91
Which of the following statements is TRUE?,"A listing contract is not a specialized form of agency contract.|Under the Designated Agency system, while the brokerage contracts with the seller or buyer, an individual licensee is appointed to act as the sole agent of that seller or buyer.|Real estate brokerages always work on behalf of the seller in respect of a real estate transaction.|An agent's authority to bind their principal depends entirely on the express authority given by the principal, and not upon implied, usual, or customary authority.","<p>Option (2) is correct because it is true. Option (1) is false because a listing contract is a specialized form of <br>agency contract. It is a contract between the seller and a real estate brokerage. T he brokerage promises to try to <br>find a b uyer and the seller promises to pay a stated amount of commission if the brokerage is successful.  Option <br>(2) is true. Designated Agency eliminates the conflict that previously a rose when two licensees in the same <br>brokerage represented both the seller and the buyer in a transaction . Option (3) is false because real estate <br>brokerages can work on behalf of a seller or a buyer on a real estate transaction. Option (4) is false because  an <br>agent’s authority to bind his or her principal can arise: (1) expressly; (2) by implication; (3) as a result of the doctrine of estoppel; or, (4) by ratification by the principal of the agent’s acts done on the principal’s behalf.</p>",Correct Option: 2,92

Option (3) is incorrect <br>because an amendment to a contract of purchase and sale will state that it does not terminate the existing <br>contract. Option (4) is incorrect because if a change is made to the contract of purchase and sale before the <br>buyer’s offer is accepted, then there is no contract of purchase and sale.

The mortgage bears interest at a contract rate of 4.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually. The mortgage has an amortization period and term of 20 years and calls for monthly payments. If the mortgage is sold to an investor for $225,000 immediately after the loan is initiated, the investor will earn the following nominal interest rate, with semi-annual compounding:",4.083034%|4.162285%|4.018729%|4.124712%,"
""<p>
 The first step to solving this problem is to find the monthly payments that the borrower has to make.

What is the result of the doctrine of stare decisis?,Former decisions are used as a basis for later decisions.|The common law system has uniformity.|Decisions by the Supreme Court of Canada are accorded the most weight in our jurisprudence.|All of the above result from the doctrine of stare decisis.,"<p>Option (4) is correct because the age of the decision does not determine which decision should govern the subsequent decision. Options (1), (2), and (3) each describe a component of the doctrine of <br>stare decisis.</p>",Correct Option: 4,148
Which of the following statements regarding the income approach of appraisal is TRUE?,"Net operating income is a measure of return on the equity portion of a property's value.|Items specific to an owner or investor are included in the calculation of net operating income.|Net operating income does not consider depreciation, income tax, or debt service.|The income approach is only used for apartment buildings.","<p>Option (3) is correct because it is true . Option (1)  is incorrect  because the net operating income represents a <br>return on the entire value of the property; it is not a return only on the equity portion of the property’ s value. <br>Option (2) is incorrect  because items speci fic to an owner or investor are NOT included in the calculation of net <br>operating income.  Option (4)  is incorrect  because the income approach can be used in appraising most types of <br>property, although it is more appropriate for properties that produce renta l income, e.g., apartment buildings, <br>office buildings, industrial space.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 3,149
"Karen's neighbour, Jack, is a gas barbecue enthusiast who cooks two meals a day, seven days a week, on his outdoor gas barbecue. As a result, the smoke and fumes are carried onto Karen's property. The barbecue smoke has discoloured Karen's dining room curtains and killed her shrubs. Which of the following statements is TRUE?","Jack may be liable to Karen for private nuisance and Karen may seek an injunction to prevent Jack from continuing the nuisance.|If Karen chooses to sue Jack for negligence, she must prove that he has breached the duty of care owed to her by a reasonable person in Jack's situation.|This scenario reveals a cause of action for interference with the airspace rights of a fee simple owner.|Karen need not prove that she has suffered any form of damage to succeed in her lawsuit against Jack because her cause of action is considered trespass and ""actionable per se"" (i.e., without proof of damage).","<p>Option (1) is correct. Karen may have a claim for private nuisance against Jack, as the interference was <br>continuous, the act was done on his land but affected Karen’s land, and it interfered with Karen’s use and <br>enjoyment of her land. An injunction is a possible remedy available under a successful action in private <br>nuisance. Option (2) is false because, if Karen  chooses to sue Jack for negligence,  she must prove  that he has <br>breached the standard  of care owed to her by a reason able person in Jack’s situation, not that he breached the <br>duty of care. Option (3) is false because the interference with airspace rights of a fee simple owner would likely <br>be an action in trespass, and in this case, Jack did not trespass, as the act was done on his land. Option (4) is false <br>because although trespass is actionable per se , Jack did not trespass onto Karen’s property. Trespass requires <br>the direct physical invasion of land by a person or tangible object.</p>",Correct Option: 1,150
Which of the following is NOT a duty that is owed by a principal to their agent?,The duty to indemnify the agent|The duty to remunerate the agent|The duty to comply with the agency agreement|The duty to avoid conflicts of interest with the agent,"<p>Option (4) is correct because the agent has a duty to avoid conflicts of interest with his or her principal, but the <br>principal does not owe this duty to his or her agent.

This applies even in the context of long term -leases where the lessor is not a tax exempt <br>organization or public body. That said, a lease contract can impose on a lessor a contractual liability to pay <br>property taxes.

Generall y, contracts respecting land in British Columbia <br>must be in writing to be enforceable, pursuant to section 59 of the Law and Equity Act . However, section 59 <br>allows an exception to this writing requirement in situations where the person seeking to enforce a n unwritten <br>contract has changed his or her position such that it would be unfair not to enforce the contract. Option (1) is <br>incorrect because there are exceptions to the writing requirement imposed by section 59. Option (2) is incorrect <br>because section 59  applies to lease agreements for more than 3 years. Option (4) is incorrect because a lease <br>agreement is not automatically void if not in writing (e.g., section 59 does not apply to lease agreements for <br>terms of 3 years or less).</p>",Correct Option: 3,153

This means that a principal could be liable to a third party under a contract entered into by their agen t where the agent failed to disclose their status as an agent, as long as the <br>agent was acting within their authority.

Which of the following could be a reason?,The property is in a state of long-term disrepair.|The property is located beside a fertilizer plant.|The appraisal was done by the cost approach.|The property is located next to a school.,"<p>Option (3) is the correct answer as the cost approach is most likely to result in an appraisal value that is <br>significantly different from the price a property might sell for.

Option (2) is incorrect because  decreasing their interest rates doesn ’t decrease the <br>amount lent out; it just creates a greater demand for loans.  Option (3) is incorrect because  increasing the <br>maximum loan to -value ratio means for a given market value of the property, the lender is willing to advance a <br>greater amount of a loan.

Option (1) is incorrect because ethical <br>standards are not the same  as the legal requirements for a licensee.  Professional ethics standards are often <br>higher standards compared to legislative standards.

Any clause contained in a mortgage that clogs the equity of redemption is:,valid.|void.|illegal.|an unreasonable restraint of trade.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because of an implied term required in mortgage law that, upon full repayment of the loan, <br>a borrower has the right to have title reconveyed to him or her in the same state as it was at the time of the <br>making of the mortgage (usually this means title will be free and clear of all encumbrances).

Option (1) is incorrect because any term which is void canno t be valid. Option (3) is incorrect because a <br>term which purports to clog the equity of redemption is not considered to be illegal; rather, it will simply not be enforced by the courts. Option (4) is incorrect because it confuses a clog on the equity of re demption with a <br>stipulation for a collateral advantage.

Option (2) is incorrect as a conventional mortgage <br>would be the most effective financing option for Jonathan in this situation. Optio n (3) is incorrect as a reverse <br>annuity mortgage would best allow Jonathan to access the equity in his home to make a purchase.

Section 273 and <br>278 of the Act provide for a “conversion schedule” or “interest schedule” that will be  employed to determine the <br>distribution of the proceeds in the event that a strata complex is destroyed and the owners decide to take the insurance money instead of rebuilding. Option (1) is incorrect because the value of each strata lot is different <br>and therefore it would be unfair to distribute insurance policy proceeds equally between all owners. Options (2) <br>and (3) are incorrect because they are based on unit entitlement, which is similar to the Schedule of Interest on <br>Destruction, which is only used fo r strata plans d eposited prior to July 1, 2000.</p>",Correct Option: 4,254

Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because the <br>comparative approach of appraisal is applicable when  there is sufficient recent sales data of similar properties, <br>and the property does not have redevelopment potential.  Option (4) is incorrect because under the comparative <br>approa ch, a property’s value should not exceed the cost of purchasing an alternative property that can provide <br>similar utility.

"In a scenario where a licensee is directly or indirectly acquiring an interest in real estate and has complied strictly with the disclosure requirements of the Real Estate Services Rules, which of the following statements is TRUE?",No conflict of interest and duty could exist.|The common law may still require further disclosure.|They may make a secret profit.|They are safe from any sort of liability arising from that purchase.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because, although the Real  Estate Services Act  outlines certain disclosure requirements in <br>Section 5 -10, the common law considers an agent’s duties and responsibilities to the principal to be one of a <br>fiduciary nature and requires a duty of loyalty, which includes both confidential ity and FULL disclosure, above <br>and beyond what is required in Section 5 -10. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because the common law may <br>extend a licensee’s disclosure responsibilities beyond the duty to disclose laid out in Section 5 -10.

Whose responsibility is it under the Assessment Act to establish actual value?,The local municipal council|The British Columbia Financial Services Authority|The Lieutenant-Governor in Council|The Assessor,"<p>Option (4) is correct because the assessor’s primary purpose under the Assessment Act  is to provide actual <br>values on which to apply t ax levies. Option (1) is incorrect because the municipal council sets the general tax <br>rate for each class of property in a given territory, but does not determine the actual value of the property. <br>Option (2) is incorrect because the British Columbia Financ ial Services Authority does not est ablish actual <br>value of property.

Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a mortgage as an investment?,Illiquid relative to government bonds|Requires a high degree of administrative work|Requires a high initial outlay of capital|Has short repayment terms and amortization periods,"<p>Option (4) is the correct answer as a mortgage typically has long terms and amortization periods. Option (1) is <br>incorrect because m ortgages do not trade publicly such as bonds and stocks, making them relatively illiquid. <br>Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because m ortgage loans also require a high degree of administrative work, and <br>a relatively high initial outlay of capital compared to other investments.</p>",Correct Option: 4,258
"Where two neighbouring landowners contract to prevent one of them from putting their land to a certain use, they are said to have created:",a licence.|a limiting caveat.|a restrictive covenant.|an easement.,"<p>Option (3) is correct because a restrictive covenant is an  interest in land which imposes a restriction on the use <br>of one person’s land (the servient tenement) for the benefit of another piece of land (the dominant tenement). Option (1) is incorrect because a licence creates a positive right, not a restriction.  Option (2) is incorrect because <br>a caveat is a notice registered against the title to land warning those searching the registrar that someone is <br>claiming an estate or interest in land against the title. Option (4) is incorrect because an easement gives the <br>holder a positive right to use the neighbouring land for his benefit, whereas a restrictive covenant prevents the <br>neighbouring land from being used in a particular way.</p>",Correct Option: 3,259
Which of the following is a valid mandatory component of the strata plan that a developer must deposit at the land title office to create a strata development?,Drawings that show the designated street address of each strata lot|A Schedule of Unit Entitlement|A copy of the Standard Rules for the strata corporation|The area of each strata lot indicated in square feet,"<p>Option (2) is correct because every strata plan must include a Schedule of Unit Entitlement. Option (1) is <br>incorrect because the required drawings must show the strata lots distinguished by number or letter in <br>consecutive order, but they are not necessarily required to show the street address of each strata lot. Option (3) <br>is incorrect because there are no Standard Rules provided in legislation, and there is no requirement for a strata corporation to create Rules. Rather, there is only a requirement for there to be bylaws in place when the strata <br>plan is filed. Option (4 ) is incorrect because the area of each strata lot must be indicated in square metres, not <br>square feet.</p>",Correct Option: 2,260
Which one of the following is the BEST reason for an investor to choose to use debt financing rather than all cash in order to purchase an income-producing property?,"The investor can deduct from taxable income the principal portion of debt repayments, thus lowering taxes payable.|A one-year term on the debt financing required is readily available.|The investor can obtain the debt financing at a lower interest rate than the expected yield on the project.|Property values are expected to decrease.","<p>Option (3) is correct because a n investor can typically procure debt financing at a rate lower than the expected <br>yield on investm ent. This allows the investor to cover the debt payments with the revenue generated from the <br>investment. Option (1) is incorrect because only the interest portion of mortgage payments are tax deductible. <br>Option (2) is incorrect as most terms are typically longer than one term, and this provides no advantage to the <br>investment. Option (4) is incorrect as the change in property values has no influence on the investor ’s choice of <br>debt or equity financing.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 3,261

What professional duty has Shaylena breached?",The duty to act honestly|The duty to communicate all offers in a timely manner|The duty to advise her client to seek independent professional advice|Shaylena has not breached any professional duties.,"<p>Option (1) is correct because licensees must act honestly with non -clients, which includes being truthful about <br>the property and the fact that Dave intends to remove the tree before the property is sold. Option (2) is incorrect <br>because an exception to the duty to communicate all offers to  the client is if a client specifically instructs their <br>licensee not to communicate offers to them promptly. Option (3) is incorrect because Shaylena has not been <br>asked to give advice outside of her area of expertise.

Options (1) and (2) are incorrect <br>because executing a contract und er seal does not remove the requirement under section 59 of the <br>Law and <br>Equity Act  that, in most cases, contracts affecting land must be in writing and signed in order to be enforceable <br>in court. Option (3) is incorrect because the parties must have intend ed to create legal obligations in order for a <br>contract to be formed, whether or not it is executed under seal.</p>",Correct Option: 4,263
Which of the following statements is TRUE?,"The total of the debit column on the seller's statement must be identical to the total of the credit column on the buyer's statement.|The practice is to hold the seller responsible for the taxes on the adjustment date itself.|On the completion date of the sale of real property, the buyer is usually entitled to the transfer of title.|The adjustment date and the possession date must be the same day.","<p>Option (3) is correct because  on the completion date the seller is obligated to transfer title and the buyer is <br>obligated to pay the purchase price in accordance with the contract for purchase and sale. Option (1) is <br>incorrect because the statements of adjustment of the buyer and seller are treated separately and are not comprised of identical information. Option (2) is incor rect because, although the amount of taxes for the year <br>are apportioned between the parties as of the adjustment date, the party “held responsible” for their share of the <br>taxes will depend on whether the property taxes for the year have been paid already b y the seller or will be due <br>in the future to be paid by the buyer. Option (4) is incorrect because, although the adjustment and possession dates are most often the same, they are not required to be so. The adjustment date may coincide with either the <br>compl etion or possession date or fall in between the two.</p>",Correct Option: 3,264
Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding GST in a transaction for the sale of real estate?,"GST generally does not apply to the amount of the deposit until the closing date.|GST will always apply to reimbursements for prepayments.|Under the Excise Tax Act, the seller is the party who is required to pay the GST.|All amounts found on the statements of adjustments are subject to GST.","<p>Option (1) is correct because payment of the deposit is generally not subject to GST until closing occurs, at <br>which time the full amount of the sale price (including the deposit) b ecomes taxable. Option (2) is incorrect <br>because no GST applies to reimbursements for prepayments. Option (3) is incorrect because under section 165(1) of the <br>Excise Tax Act , the buyer (the “recipient”) has the obligation to pay the GST. Option (4) is incor rect <br>because only amounts on the statements of adjustments that are legally components of the purchase price are <br>subject to GST.</p>",Correct Option: 1,265

Which of the following statements is TRUE?",S has entered into a contract with both A and B.|S could have revoked the offer to A and avoided the problem.|S was entitled to accept B's offer.|All of the above three statements are true.,"<p>Option (4) is correct because all of the above statements are true. Option (1) is true  because a contrac t is formed <br>when there is unequivocal acceptance of an offer. When S accepted B’s offer to purchase the property for <br>&#36;75,000, a contract between S and B was formed. Then, w hen A accepted S’s offer to purchase the property for <br>&#36;50,000 within the time period  stipulated in the offer, a contract between A and S was formed. Option (2) is true  <br>because an offer expires when the offeror communicates revocation before acceptance, so A would no longer <br>have been able to accept S’s offer. Option (3) is true because S i s entitled to accept B’s offer, but S will be liable <br>for damages to A because S cannot convey the property as promised and will be in breach of their contract.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 4,266

Since Duke forged the transfer document, he is not protected <br>by indefeasibility and Ear l will be able to recover title to Blackacre from Duke.

Option (1) is inco rrect because a <br>mutual mistake occurs when each party makes a different fundamental mistake about the contract, and in this <br>case the same mistake was made. Option (2) is incorrect because frustration of a contract happens due to events <br>occurring after the contract was entered into, and here the home was destroyed before the contract was formed. <br>Option (4) is incorrect because an anticipatory breach occurs when one party announces that he or she will not <br>perform before the time of performance arrives, which has not occurred in this scenario.</p>",Correct Option: 3,277

"A ""subject to"" clause in a contract of purchase and sale is correctly known as a:",condition precedent.|warranty.|condition subsequent.|penalty clause.,"<p>Option (1) is correct because a condition precedent is a condition in a contract which must be satisfied before <br>the contract is to be performed, and is the formal term for what is usually called a “subject to” clause in the real <br>estate industry. Options (2), (3), and (4 ) are types of clauses which might be found in a contract that are distinct <br>from “subject to” clauses. Option (2) is incorrect because a warranty is a clause which is not fundamental to the <br>contract and whose breach would not allow a party to terminate the  contract, only to sue for damages. Option <br>(3) is incorrect because “subject to” clauses must are conditions precedent (they precede contractual <br>performance) rather than conditions subsequent. Option (4) is incorrect because a penalty clause is a clause <br>which states that a party who breaches the contract must pay a penalty to the innocent party. These clauses will <br>not be enforced by the courts.</p>",Correct Option: 1,286
"Once a licensee has obtained a signed acceptance from Allan of an offer to sell real estate owned by Bob and Carol jointly, the Real Estate Services Act requires the delivery of a copy of the agreement to:","Allan and Bob.|Allan, Bob, and Carol.|Bob.|Carol.","<p>Option (2) is correct because the Real Estate Services Act  requires a signed copy of the ac ceptance to be <br>delivered to each of the parties to the transaction. Therefore, Allan, Bob, and Carol each require an individual <br>copy as they are all parties to the transaction. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because they would each <br>result in a par ty to the transaction not receiving a signed copy of the agreement.</p>",Correct Option: 2,287
"When attempting to determine whether a particular relationship is that of landlord and tenant or licensor and licensee, it is best to:",look at the formal wording of the document.|look at the substance of the agreement between the parties.|consult the Residential Tenancy Act.|consult the Commercial Tenancies Act.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because the test to determine whether an agreement create s a lease or a licence is a matter <br>of intention between the parties, which is determined by examining the agreement, the surrounding <br>circumstances, and the purpose behind the agreement. Option (1) is incorrect because formal wording and <br>inclusion of terms i n an agreement such as “lessor/lessee” or “licensor/licensee” will not necessarily be <br>determinative of parties’ intentions. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because the Residential Tenancy Act  and <br>the Commercial Tenancy Act do not apply to the holder of a  licence.</p>",Correct Option: 2,288
"The comparative approach of appraisal is based on an analysis of recent sale prices for similar properties. Which of the following BEST defines the word ""recent""?",A period of time during which at least four properties have sold in the subject property's neighbourhood|A period of time of no less than one week and no more than six months|A period of time during which supply and demand conditions have not changed|A period of time during which the prime interest rate has been stable,"<p>Option (3) is correct because in the comparative approach of appraisal, “ recent ” refers to a time period during <br>which demand and supply conditions in the area are relatively stable or do not change. “ Recent ” is the period of <br>time, immediately preceding the appraisal date, during which property values in the region have remained <br>stable.  Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect for this reason.</p>",Correct Option: 3,289
"Mortgage interest rates are sometimes described as being ""sticky""; that is, changes in mortgage rates tend to lag behind changes in bond yields. One reason for this ""stickiness"" is:",the short-term nature of a mortgage loan contract.|the weak secondary mortgage market.|mortgages are highly liquid investments.|all mortgage investments are identical.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because a  weak secondary market for mo rtgages means that there are not a large amount of <br>buyers and sellers of mortgages that already exist. Due to this, the investors ’ funds are “locked in ” to the interest <br>rate written in their original contracts, and they cannot achieve the current rate unti l the end of the term, or <br>until they recover enough capital to initiate a new mortgage at the new rate. Options (1), (3), and (4) are <br>incorrect because they do not describe reasons for mortgage rates’ “stickiness”.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 2,290
"Hurston, an employee of XYZ Preservatives Ltd., is in the habit of venting a cloud of highly toxic gas into the air at dusk every evening. Once it escapes, the cloud usually drifts over Ralph's apple orchard. Hurston's actions are strictly against company policy but by venting the gas Hurston saves time. Hurston is aware that the gas is highly toxic. Ralph has discovered that the emissions have destroyed his apple crop. Which one of the following statements is TRUE?","XYZ will not be liable for Hurston's acts because Hurston was acting contrary to XYZ's rules.|Ralph may be successful in a claim against XYZ based on the principle of private nuisance.|While Ralph will probably succeed in a claim against XYZ based on negligence, he will not have any remedy against Hurston.|Ralph would probably have a successful claim against XYZ based on the provisions of the Occupiers Liability Act.","<p>Option (2) is correct because private nuisance occurs when an owner or occupier of land unreasonably and <br>substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a neighbouring property, which includes <br>activities which product noxious fumes. Hurst on’s venting highly toxic gas over Ralph’s apple orchard, <br>destroying his crop, would classify as an unreasonable and substantial interference with Ralph’s ability to use <br>and enjoy his land. Option (1) is incorrect because XYZ could be vicariously liable for Hurston’s activities as <br>their employee or negligent for failing to prevent Hurston from creating the nuisance. Option (3) is incorrect because Ralph would have a remedy against Hurston, as the person who created the nuisance is liable for doing <br>so. Option (4) is incorrect because the <br>Occupiers Liability Act  would only apply if Ralph and/or his property <br>had been harmed while on XYZ’s property.</p>",Correct Option: 2,291
A borrower would prefer a straight line principal reduction plan to a constant payment plan if the borrower:,wishes to delay repayment as long as possible.|foresees their income decreasing.|foresees their income increasing.|wishes to keep their initial payments as low as possible.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because a  characteristic of a straight line principal reduction loan is that payments will <br>decrease over time. This is favourable to a borrower that expects his or her income to decrease in the future. <br>Option (1 ) is incorrect because a straight line principal reduction plan does not permit a borrower to delay <br>repayment , as i t provides for higher initial payments . Option (3) is incorrect because a borrower who foresees <br>his or her income increasing would prefer to make higher payments in the future, rather than immediately. <br>Option (4) is incorrect because initial payments will  be higher than future payments.</p>",Correct Option: 2,292
Which of the following situations involves a breach of a duty owed by a licensee to a client?,"Julio, a licensee, discovers the property his client Emma is interested in contains asbestos. He immediately discloses this information to Emma.|Gabriel, a licensee, is asked a complex question about mortgages by his client Koshi. Gabriel, unsure if he has the required expertise to answer the question, refers Koshi to a competent mortgage broker.|Billy receives an offer from Asuna to purchase his client Joel's property. Asuna tells Billy she wants to demolish the existing house, and asks him not to tell Joel. Billy does not tell Joel the plans for the property, as Asuna asked him not to.|Simon receives six offers to purchase the house of his clients, the Garfunkels. Although two offers are significantly lower than the rest, he presents every offer to his clients.","<p>Option (3) is correct because the duty of full disclosure requires Billy to disclose all known material information <br>to his client, including the buyer’s intentions for the property. Option (1) is incorrect because Julio has followed <br>his professional obligations and satisfied the duty of full disclosure. Option (2) is incorrect because Gabriel has <br>fulfilled his duty to advise his client to seek independent professional advice on matters outside of his expertise. <br>Option (4) is incorrect because Simon has communicated all of the offers he received to his client and fulfilled <br>his professional obligations .</p>",Correct Option: 3,293
Which of the following would appear as a debit on the seller's statement of adjustment?,The amount of a mortgage that the buyer will assume|The legal fees involved in discharging a judgment from the seller's title|The amount of a penalty owing for overdue taxes|All of the above would appear as a debit on the seller's statement,"<p>Option (4) is correct  because all of the statements would appear as debits on t he seller’s statement . Option (1) <br>would appear as a debit on the seller’s statement of adjustments because an existing mortgage on title which <br>will be assumed by the buyer on completion of the sale reduces the amount of cash that the buyer will owe to <br>the seller. For Option (2), the seller is responsible for clearing the title of any encumbrances and any fees for this <br>are the responsibility of the seller, which would reduce the amount of cash due to him or her and would be <br>shown as a debit to the seller. Fo r Option (3), the seller is liable to pay overdue taxes and any penalty owing as a <br>result of late payment. This reduces the amount of cash owed to the seller and would appear as a debit on their <br>statement of adjustments.</p>",Correct Option: 4,294
"As a general principle, which one of the following is the proper method of communicating acceptance of an offer?",In writing|In the same form as the offer|By registered mail|By telephone,"<p>Option (2) is correct because the offeree should generally communicate acceptance using the same method as the offer was made , if the offer d oes not specify otherwise.  Options (1), ( 3), and (4) are incorrect because they do <br>not generally describe the proper means of  communicating acceptance. Rather, they are methods of <br>communication  that are potentially acceptable , depending on the way in which the offer was communicated  <br>and the terms of the offer .  <br></p>",Correct Option: 2,295
Which one of the following transactions does NOT affect the amount of owner's equity?,Investments by the owner|Personal withdrawals from the business|Net income earned|Purchase of assets by the business,"<p>Option (4) is correct because purchas ing asse ts will not affect owner ’s equity. The purchase of the assets will <br>either be funded by cash that  will result in no net change in assets, or it will be funded by debt, which will <br>increase both assets and liabilities.  Option (1) is incorrect because  Investment by the owner will increase the <br>amount of equit y. Option (2) is incorrect because personal withdrawals from the business will decrease the <br>amount of equity. Option (3) is incorrect because e arning net income will also increase the amount of equity.</p>",Correct Option: 4,296
"Where a landlord refuses to allow a commercial tenant to take possession of the demised premises, the tenant may:",get an order for specific performance.|maintain an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.|sue the landlord for damages.|do none of the above.,"<p>Option (3) is correct because there is an implied covenant on the part of a commercial landlord to let the tenant <br>into possession of the leased premises and, if they do not do so, they will be liable for damages. Option (1) is <br>incorrect b ecause a commercial tenant cannot get an order for specific performance in these circumstances due <br>to the common law doctrine of interesse termini , which provides that no estate in land passes until the tenant <br>takes possession. Option (2) is incorrect because quiet enjoyment relates to the tenant’s ability to use and enjoy <br>the premises for all usual purposes without interference or unreasonable disturbance from the landlord, which <br>would apply once the tenant is already in possession of the premises. Opt ion (4) is incorrect because the tenant <br>would be entitled to sue the landlord for damages.</p>",Correct Option: 3,297
Which one of the following does NOT form part of the definition of market value?,Value is a price that is reasonably expected to prevail.|Value is based on the personal opinion of the value to the owner.|Value is determined at a particular point in time.|The buyer and seller must be bargaining at arm's length.,"<p>Option (2) is the correct answer because this option represents the subjective value to the owner. Market value <br>should be an objective value a t a specific point in time.  Options (1), (3), and (4) all form part of the definition of <br>market value.</p>",Correct Option: 2,298
Who may claim a home owner grant?,"Anybody whose name appears on the assessment roll|The tenant of a property, if they have a lease exceeding three years|The owner of a property, whether they live there or not|The owner-occupier of a property","<p>Option (4) is correct because the basic criteria to qualify for a home owner grant is that the person claiming the <br>grant must be t he owner of the property and must occupy it as a principal residence. Option (1) is incorrect <br>because an owner’s name may appear on the assessment roll, but they would not qualify for a home owner grant if they were not  occupying the property. Option (2) i s incorrect because a tenant is not an owner of the <br>property. Option (3) is incorrect because an owner must live at the property in order to claim a home owner <br>grant.</p>",Correct Option: 4,299
"To qualify for a managing broker's licence, a person must possess which one of the following qualifications?",Have at least five years' experience as a representative in British Columbia|Be a Canadian citizen|Be at least 19 years of age|None of the above are qualifications for a managing broker's licence.,"<p>Option (3) is correct because, in addition to the educational and experience requirements, the Real Estate <br>Services Act (RESA ) requires that an applicant must be at least 19 years of age. Option (1) is incorrect because <br>qualification for a managing broker’s licence requires a licensee to have been providing real estate s ervices in a <br>Canadian province or the Yukon for at least two years during the five years before the date of the application. <br>Option (2) is incorrect because Canadian citizenship is not required to qualify for a managing broker’s licence. <br>Option (4) is inco rrect because a minimum of 19 years of age is required under RESA.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 3,300
"If a licensee falls into the narrow exception in the Rules for the practice of dual agency, they must ensure that which of the following agreements is entered into before providing services within the dual agency relationship?",An Agreement Regarding Conflict of Interest Between Clients|A written agreement of dual agency|A Disclosure of Interest in Trade form|A Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form,"<p>Option (2) is correct because a licensee must obtain a written agreement of dual agency by both clients before <br>providing services within the dual agency relationship . Option (1) is incorrect because an Agreement Regarding <br>Conflict of Interest Between Clients is entered into when a licensee faces a conflict of interest when acting for multiple clients, and obtains written consent by all clients to continue to represent  only one client. Option (3) is <br>incorrect because a Disclosure of Interest in Trade form is required when a licensee or an associate of a licensee <br>(being provided real estate services by the licensee) is to directly or indirectly acquire or dispose of real  estate. <br>Option (4) is incorrect because a Disclosure of Risks to Unrepresented Parties form is required when a licensee <br>makes a disclosure under section 5 4 of the Rules to an unrepresented party while also representing a client to <br>that trade in real estat e.</p>",Correct Option: 2,301
"It is a violation of the Real Estate Services Rules for a licensee to promise an owner that, if the owner enters into a listing agreement with the licensee's brokerage, then the licensee will sell the owner's property within a certain time, UNLESS:",full disclosure is made to both seller and buyer.|a signed statement setting forth the details of the promise is given to the person to whom the promise is made when the promise is made.|a copy of such promise is sent to the British Columbia Financial Services Authority.|a statement under oath acknowledging the promise (but lacking details of the promise) is provided to the person to whom the promise is made.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because under section s 49 and 50  of the Rules, licensees are prohibited from making <br>promises to others in an attempt to induce them to enter into service agreements or enter into real estate <br>transactions UNLESS the licensee delivers a signed statement setting out the details of the promise to the <br>person to whom the promise is made . Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect because making full disclosure to <br>both the seller and the buyer, sending a copy of such a promise to the  British Columbia Financial Services <br>Authority, and providing a statement under oath without details of the promise  will not be enough to prevent a <br>violation of the rule if the signed statemen t containing details is not given to the promisee.</p>",Correct Option: 2,302

"Corey has offered $431,000 for a house, providing he is able to obtain acceptable financing. The house lists for $442,000, but the lender has determined the lending value is $440,000. The lender requires a loan-to-value ratio of 80% and a gross debt service ratio of 32%. Property taxes are $2,750 per year and Corey's annual gross income is $75,000. If the interest rate is 6% per annum, compounded semi-annually, the amortization period is 20 years, and payments are made monthly, what is the maximum amount this lender will advance, rounded to the nearest $10?","$352,000|$230,530|$248,650|$320,640","<p>
 To answer  this question, calculate the maximum amount of money that can be lent out given the two
 <br/>
 constraints: the loan -to-value amount and the gross debt  service ratio amount. Calculate the loan amount for
 <br/>
 the loan -to-value constraint and then calculate the loan amount for the GDSR constraint. In order to determine
 <br/>
 the maximum amount that the lender will advance, choose the lesser of the two results.
 <br/>
 <br/>

<p><em>LTV = 80%</em></p>

<p>
  Lending Value = $440,000<br/>
  Maximum loan under lender’s LTV criteria = 0.8 × $440,000 = $352,000

Option (1) is incorrect <br>because a restrictive covenant imposes a restriction on the use of one person’s land for the benefit of another, <br>and this document grants a positive right to use the land rather than a restriction. Option (2) is incorrect <br>because a lease grants a right to possession for a certain amount of time, whereas this interest does not have an <br>end date attached to it and it does not grant exclusive possession to the property. Option (3) is incorrect because <br>a license is a privilege to enter onto premises for a certain pur pose that is a personal right (i.e. can only be <br>exercised by the person to whom it was granted) whereas this right is an interest which runs with the property rather than to Mary exclusively.</p>",Correct Option: 4,335

 The cost of funds advanced is greater than the contract equivalent rate of 9.2025%. However, calculations are
 not required. Given the inverse  relationship between the present value and interest rates, since the present
 value declines (all else constant), t he interest rate increases (as supported by the above calculations).
</p>",Correct Option: 3,345
Which of the following options is the generally accepted accounting principle that holds that all accounting information should be reported on objectively determined and verifiable data?,Consistency principle|Verification principle|Materiality principle|Objectivity principle,"<p>Option (4) is correct because t he objectivity principle states that all accounting information needs to be <br>objectively determined , as well as  verifiable. Option (1)  is incorrect because t he consistency principle states that <br>once an accounting policy is adopted, the company must continue to use the same policy in the future. Option <br>(2) is incorrect because t he verification principle is not a generally accepted accounting principle. Option (3) is <br>incorrect because t he materiality principle is not studied in this course.</p>",Correct Option: 4,346
Which of the following is NOT a procedure commonly used by a large institutional lender in order to reduce the risk associated with a particular mortgage loan?,Reduction of the loan-to-value ratio|Increase in the interest rate charged|Reduction in the gross debt service ratio|Reduction in the total debt service ratio,"<p>Option (2) is correct because i ncreasing the interest rate is a way to accommodate increased risk by providing <br>increased return for the lender, but this does not reduce the risk. In fact, a higher interest rate will result in a <br>higher payment, making the risk of default even greater. Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect  because they <br>represent ways that a lender can reduce risk.</p>",Correct Option: 2,347
"Where an offer has been made by post, an acceptance by post will be effective:","when posted.|when received.|when received, provided it is not lost in the mail.|when posted, provided it is not lost in the mail.","<p>Option (1) is correct because where acceptance is intended to be by non -instantaneous means, which includes <br>by post, the acceptance is effective when it is put in the mail r ather than when it is actually received. If the <br>acceptance is lost in the mail, there is still a binding contract as long as the offeree can prove the acceptance was <br>actually mailed. For these reasons, Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect.</p>",Correct Option: 1,348
Which of the following is NOT a requirement of the Real Estate Development Marketing Act to protect the public?,Developers must meet any preliminary requirements or approvals applicable to the type of property being marketed.|Developers must assure the buyer's title upon purchase.|Developers must prepare and file a disclosure statement in the form required.|Developers must consult with members of the public over any proposed developments.,"<p>Option (4) is correct because there is no requirement for developers to consult with the public over proposed <br>developments under t he Real Estate Development Marketing Act (REDMA ). Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect <br>because developers are req uired to do each of these things under REDMA.  Its purpose is to protect purchasers <br>by requiring developers who market or intend to market development units in development properties to: m eet <br>any preliminary requirements or approvals applicable to the type of property to be marketed;  ensure <br>appropriate steps are taken to pay the cost of utilities or other related services and to assure the purchaser’s title <br>(or other interest) upon purchase; and  prepare and file a disclosure option in the form required by th e BC <br>Financial Services Authority.</p>",Correct Option: 4,349
Which one of the following is NOT a remedy available to the owner of a strata lot who is dissatisfied with certain actions of the strata corporation?,The owner may obtain a mandatory injunction against the strata corporation.|The owner may file a lien against the strata corporation.|The owner may have an arbitrator appointed.|The owner may apply to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for an order requiring the strata corporation to comply with the Strata Property Act.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because an owner cannot file a lien against the strata corporation because they are dissatisfied with the corporation’s actions. However, if an owner sues a strata corporation and succeeds, they <br>may receive a judgment against the strata corporation. Options (1), ( 3), and (4 ) are incorrect because they are all <br>remedies available under the<br> Strata Property Act  to an owner who is dissatisfied with acts of the strata <br>corporation.</p>",Correct Option: 2,350
"After determining that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to a money laundering or terrorist financing offence, when must a licensee file a Suspicious Transaction Report?",After receiving approval from the licensee's managing broker|When directed to file by a local law enforcement agency|As soon as practicable|Within 15 days of receiving any funds from the client,"<p>Option (3) is correct because a licensee is required to file a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) as soon as practicable. Option (1) is incorrect because individual licensees have an obligation under the <br>Proceeds of Crime <br>(Money Lau ndering) and Terrorist Financing Act to file STRs, whether or not the managing broker approves. <br>Option (2) is incorrect because law enforcement direction is not required to file an STR. Option (4) is incorrect <br>because it is the requirement for filing a Lar ge Cash Transaction Report. There is no specified number of days <br>required for filing an STR, because the requirement is that it be filed as soon as practicable . <br></p>",Correct Option: 3,351
Which of the following statements is TRUE under the Torrens system in British Columbia?,A person whose fee simple title was transferred by a void deed can always recover title upon proving that they were the rightful owner.|The indefeasibility principle expresses the fundamental tenet that one cannot give what one does not have.|A void deed has no legal effect and is not capable of transferring any title in the land from the vendor to the purchaser.|Registered fee simple owners enjoy the guarantee of indefeasibility but registered chargeholders do not.,"<p>Option (4) is correct because in British Columbia, only fee simple owner s are protected by the guarantee of <br>indefeasibility. In Gill v. Bucholtz  (2009) the British Columbia Court of Appeal confirmed that the Land Tile Act <br>preserves the common law principle that “one cannot give another person that property which one does not <br>have” with respect to registered charges. Options (1) and (3) are incorrect because under British Columbia’s <br>Torrens system, the indefeasibility principle provides that when a person is named on a certificate of title as the <br>owner of the fee simple estate i n land, that is conclusive proof that he or she is entitled to that fee simple estate. <br>Therefore, a fee simple owner cannot recover title from a good faith purchaser who acquires fee simple title by <br>way of a void deed. Option (2) is incorrect because nemo dat quod non habet is the fundamental common law <br>tenet that one cannot give what one does not have, which would protect the rightful owner. The indefeasibility <br>principle protects the registered fee simple owner.</p>",Correct Option: 4,352
"In conducting an appraisal, a market analysis is undertaken covering a range of factors. Which of the following is NOT a reason for including a market analysis in an appraisal report?",To indicate the current status of the subject property in relation to trends in property values|To confirm that comparable properties have been selected from the same market as the subject property and are subject to the same market forces|To provide the client with an appreciation of the socio-economic determinants of supply and demand|To reconcile the market value,"<p>Option (4) is the co rrect answer as reconciling the market value of the subject property is not a reason to include <br>a market analysis in the appraisal report. Options (1), (2) and (3) are incorrect because they are valid reasons to <br>include the market analysis in the appraisal  report.</p>",Correct Option: 4,353
"When an agent acting within the scope of their authority and having disclosed that they are acting as an agent enters into a contract with a third party, the parties to that contract are:","the agent and the principal.|the principal and the third party.|the third party and the agent.|the principal, the agent, and the third party.","<p>Option (2) is correct because an agent is a person authorized to act on behalf of another person, the principal, so <br>that they represent the principal in dealings with third parties. Therefore, while the agent is acting within the <br>scope of his authority as an agent and after having disclosed that he is an agent for the principal, the contract <br>will be between the principal for whom the agent is acting and the third party. Option (1) is incorrect because, <br>although there would be a contract between the agent an d the principal in order to establish the agency <br>relationship, in this case the contract is with a third party. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because the agent is <br>acting on behalf of the principal as if he were stepping into the principal’s shoes rathe r than contracting for <br>himself; therefore, the agent is not party to the agreement.</p>",Correct Option: 2,354
A lease granted by a tenant for a term that is less than the whole of their remaining interest granted in the original lease is referred to as:,an assignment.|a tenancy by sufferance.|a sub-lease.|a tenancy at will.,"<p>Option (3) is correct because a sub -lease is a lease by the original tenant (the sub -landlord) to a third party for <br>less than the total remainder of the sub -landlord’s original lease term. Option (1) is incorrect because an <br>assignment is the transfer by a party of all of the party’s interest in a property, i.e. for the total remainder of the <br>lease term rather than a portion of it. Option (2) is incorr ect because a tenancy by sufferance occurs when there <br>is no tenancy because no lease exists . For example, if a tenant does not move out of the leased premises upon <br>the expiration of the term of the lease. Option (4) is incorrect because a tenancy at will i s where the tenant, with <br>the consent of the landlord, occupies land as a tenant for a term which can be terminated by either party at any <br>time.</p>",Correct Option: 3,355
Benson has purchased a home from Vanessa. The sale is completed on April 15 and the property taxes are adjusted on the completion date. Property taxes are due on July 1. In this case:,Vanessa will have to pay Benson for the share of the taxes from January 1 through April 14.|Vanessa and Benson will each pay Ã‚Â½ of the current year's taxes on July 1 when they are due.|Benson will have to pay Vanessa for his share of the year's taxes after she pays them on July 1.|Neither Vanessa nor Benson will have to pay any taxes on July 1 because the sale completed on April,"<p>Option (1) is correct because where property taxes are to be paid in the future by the buyer, the seller owes the <br>share of taxes from January 1 up to the adjustment date, in this case, up to April 14 as the adjustment date is <br>April 15. Option (2) is incorrect because taxes are split according to the proportion of the year that each party <br>has ownership of the property rather than an equal split. Option (3) is incorrect because Benson is responsible <br>for paying taxes on July 1. Vanessa will have to pay Benson for her share of taxes from January 1 t hrough April <br>14. Option (4) is incorrect because  the property taxes will have to be paid regardless of when the sale completes.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 1,356
A statement of profit and loss measures which of the following?,Assets acquired during a certain period of time|Revenues and expenses for a certain period of time|Revenues accrued at a single point in time|Assets and liabilities held at a single point in time,"<p>Option (2) is correct because t he statement of profit and loss, also known as the income statement, measures <br>revenues and expenses for a certain time per iod. Option (1) is incorrect because t here is no financial statement <br>that reflects the acquisition of assets of a certain period of time . Option (3) is incorrect because  there is no <br>financial statement that measures the revenues accrued at a single point i n time. Option (4) is incorrect because <br>the balance sheet is the financial statement that measures the assets and liabilities held at a single point in time.</p>",Correct Option: 2,357
The greatest bundle of rights and responsibilities that an individual can hold with respect to land is:,a fee simple interest.|a 99-year lease.|an easement.|a life estate pur autre vie.,"<p>Option (1) is correct because the estate in fee simple is the greatest estate in Canadian law, equivalent to what <br>we ordinarily think of as outright ownership of real property, where the owner has rights to the land for so long <br>as he or she has heirs. This includes the right to freely use and enjoy it, sell it, rent or lease it, grant mortgages or <br>easements or other interests in land, and to dispose of it under the terms of a will. Options (2) and (4) are <br>incorrect because leasehold estates and estates pur autre vie are estates in land less than fee simple since the interests have a prescribed end date and other conditions or obligations attached to the use and enjoyment of <br>the land. Option (3) is incorrect because an easement is an interest in land less tha n an estate as it is a limited <br>right to use another’s land rather than a full right to possession of the property.</p>",Correct Option: 1,358
"With respect to the valuation of real property, value to the owner is most often required to be estimated in the context of:","churches and heritage buildings.|investment analysis.|a stable, unchanged market.|mortgage lending practice.","<p>Option (2) is the correct answer because the value to owner cannot be used in appraisal, but may be used in <br>investmen t analysis.  Options (1), (3), and (4) are incorrect for this reason.</p>",Correct Option: 2,359
Which of the following correctly lists goods from the LEAST amount of shopping effort required to the MOST amount of shopping effort required?,"Convenience goods, shopping goods, specialty goods, unsought goods|Shopping goods, convenience goods, unsought goods, specialty goods|Unsought goods, convenience goods, shopping goods, specialty goods|Convenience goods, unsought goods, specialty goods, shopping goods","<p>Option (3) is correct because t he shopping behaviour model classifies products and services based on the <br>amount of effort that a consumer is willing to go through t o obtain that product or service. In order of the <br>amount of effort required by the consumer, from the least effort to the most effort, the goods are unsought <br>goods, convenience goods, shopping goods, and specialty goods.  Options (1), (2), and (4) are incor rect for this <br>reason.</p>",Correct Option: 3,360
"Which marketing effort focuses on a relatively small, but active and growing, target market?",Undifferentiated marketing|Differentiated marketing|Specialty marketing|Niche marketing,<p>Option (4) is correct because n iche marketing focuses on a relatively small but active and growing target <br>market. Option (1) is incorrect because undifferentiated marketing is when a single product or service is  <br>marketed to all potential consumers with a single marketing program. Option (2) is incorrect because <br>differentiated marketing refers to numerous similar products being marketed to different market segments <br>using different marketing programs. Option (3) is  incorrect because s pecialty marketing is a term not used in <br>this course.  <br></p>,Correct Option: 4,361

"When completing a listing contract, a licensee should:","rely on all of the information provided by the seller.|only rely on the seller's information if the seller says they have checked it.|independently check information with the appropriate authority where possible.|use the seller's information, but advise all buyers that it is unreliable.","<p>Option (3) is correct because a listing licensee has a duty to verify information for the listing and may be liable if <br>they fail to do so and the buyers incur damages as a result. Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because they <br>would not meet the licensee’s duty to independently check the information provided to them by the seller <br>where possible.</p>",Correct Option: 3,363
An assignment of a commercial lease may be made by a tenant to a third party:,only if there is an express provision in the lease allowing the tenant to do so.|only if the tenant has a licence to do so from the landlord.|only if the landlord's consent can be implied from the course of dealings leading up to the execution of the lease.|unless the tenant is specifically prevented from doing so by a covenant in the lease.,"<p>Option (4) is correct because a tenant under a commercial lease may assign without the co nsent of the landlord <br>unless there is an express prohibition in the lease. Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect because the <br>presumption is that assignment is allowed unless otherwise specified in the lease, and none of the situations in <br>these options ar e required for the presumption to prevail.</p>",Correct Option: 4,364
"A developer of land not located in a municipality filed the necessary disclosure statement with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority with respect to his 20 lot subdivision. After foreclosure proceedings, the developer's bank became the owner of the subdivision. The bank wishes to sell the lots on an individual basis. Which one of the following statements is TRUE?","Because the bank is selling more than five lots, it should file a disclosure statement with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority.|A further disclosure statement is not necessary.|The disclosure statement filed by the developer will satisfactorily protect people who purchase lots from the bank.|Because there has been a foreclosure, the bank is obligated to file a prospectus rather than a disclosure statement.","<p>Option (1) is correct because under the Real Estate Development Marketing Act , a new disclosure statement is <br>required when the identity  of the developer changes. A  developer is defined as a person who, directly or <br>indirectly owns, leases or has a right to acquire or dispose of development property, subject to exclusion by <br>regulation. Therefore, the bank would be considered a new developer and would have to file a new disclosure <br>statement. For this reason, Options (2) and (3) are incorrect. Option (4) is incorrect because there is no requirement to file a prospectus rather than a disclosure statement in the event of a foreclosure.</p>",Correct Option: 1,365
Which one of the following statements is FALSE?,"Given that the net operating income remains constant, the market value of a property falls as the required yield rises.|The market value of an income-producing property is best determined by averaging the sale prices of any three other income producing properties that have recently sold.|In the determination of an income-producing property's market value, an appraiser should not confuse gross realized income with net operating income.|The capitalization rate applied to the net operating income of an investment property is related to the yield on comparable investment properties.","<p>Option (2) is  correct  because, in the income approach of appraisal, the market value for any particular real <br>estate property is determined by the yields that prospective purchasers reasonably expect to earn.

Option (1) is incorrect because Principle 10 is to provide <br>recourse. O ption (2) is incorrect because Principle 2 is to obtain consent.

"In commercial mortgage underwriting, the factor calculated by dividing the annual net operating income by the annual sum of monthly mortgage payments is referred to as the:",safety margin factor.|mortgage ratio.|debt coverage ratio.|annual mortgage constant.,"<p>Option (3) is correct because t he debt coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the annual net operating income <br>by the annual sum of mortgage payments.

A counter-offer has the effect in law of:,leaving the original offer open for acceptance if the counter-offer is refused.|terminating the original offer so that later it cannot be accepted.|terminating all negotiations at that time.|accepting the original offer.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because a counter -offer terminate s the original offer to become the new offer. Option (1) is <br>incorrect because if the counteroffer is not accepted, the offeree cannot accept the first offer because it has <br>already terminated.

An event <br>which frustrates the continuation of the agency contract would also terminate the relationship.

"Charlie Brown and his sister, Sally, moved in next door to the house owned by Lucy VanPelt. Every afternoon, Lucy's friend and tenant, Schroeder, a concert pianist, would practise on the VanPelt grand piano. Unfortunately, Sally, who worked the night shift, was a very light sleeper and was unable to sleep during Schroeder's rehearsals. At Sally's request, Charlie explained to his new neighbour that the piano playing caused the Brown house to vibrate, and Sally could not sleep. Lucy just replied, ""Too bad,"" and slammed the door on Charlie's face. Which of the following statements is TRUE?","Lucy could successfully defend an action in private nuisance brought by the Browns for the piano vibrations by pleading volenti non fit injuriae, that is, that the Browns moved to the nuisance.|Sally's condition of being a light sleeper would be a relevant factor in measuring the reasonableness of the noise, and Lucy will have to consider Sally's condition in assessing her own conduct.|In order to be successful in a private nuisance suit, Charlie and Sally must prove that they have either suffered some interference with the use and enjoyment of, or physical damage to, their property.|If Charlie and Sally brought an action, only Lucy, as the landlord and occupier of the land would be liable for the nuisance.","<p>Option (3) is correct because the two types of damages recognized in the case of a private nuisance are <br>unreasonable interference with another occupier’s use and enjoyment of property, and interference which causes physical damage to the property. Option (1) is incorrect because the courts have held that it is  no defence <br>to a nuisance action to say that the plaintiff came to the nuisance. Option (2) is incorrect because the standard <br>against which reasonableness is measured is that of the average reasonable person, and it is not relevant that a <br>plaintiff happens  to be unusually sensitive unless the defendant seeks to take advantage of that fact. Option (4) <br>is incorrect because the person who creates the nuisance (in this case, Schroeder) is liable for creating it, and in <br>a landlord and tenant situation, the tenan t occupier is primarily liable for nuisances created on the property.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 3,372
Which of the following is the main reason that interest accruing loans are normally written for short terms?,"For long terms, borrowers generally prefer to make periodic payments.|Total payments decline over the term of an interest accruing loan, so the sooner the loan is refinanced, the higher the potential return to the lender.|The lender's return and original investment are at risk for the entire term of an interest accruing loan.|The outstanding balance of an interest accruing loan declines over the term of the loan, so it is prudent for the lender to keep the term short.","<p>Option (3) is correct because an i nterest accruing loan  poses a high risk to the lender , since  the entire amount of <br>principal and interest is outstanding for the e ntire length of the term. Due to this, these loans are typically <br>written for short terms. Option (1) is incorrect because although it is a true statement, it is not the reason <br>interest accruing loans are written for short terms.

Which of the following definitions accurately describes such a clause?","The clause requires the removal of the condition precedent within a reasonable time.|The clause states specifically the date by which the condition precedent must be removed.|The clause permits the seller to require the removal of the condition precedent within a specified time, if a better offer is received.|None of the above three statements accurately describes a ""time clause"".","<p>Option (3) is correct because a time clause in a contract for purchase and sale of land allows a party to invoke a <br>time period in which a condition precedent must be removed, where the right to invoke the clause arises on the <br>vendor receiving another offer after entering the original contract of purchase and sale. Option (1) is incorrect <br>because it must be for a specified time period, not just a “reasonable time.” Option (2) is incorrect because the <br>date by which the condition precedent must be removed depends on the vendor receiving another offer, and so <br>the time per iod is set out in the contract during which the condition must be removed rather than a specified <br>date.

Listed below is one of the most important powers given to municipal councils in regulating the subdivision of land. Identify it.,They may require that all lots within the proposed subdivision be capable of being served by cable television.|They may require that all residential units within the proposed subdivision be in excess of a certain construction value specified in the bylaw.|They may require that not more than one lot in the proposed subdivision be sold to any given buyer in order to discourage speculation in building lots.|They may require that highways of a prescribed standard be provided as well as street lighting and underground wiring.,"<p>Option (4) is correct because the Local Government Act  provides that subdivision bylaws created by municipal <br>councils may regulate the location, width, alignment and grade of highways and may also require that the <br>subdivider provide street lighting and underground (as well as wiring, water, sewer and drainage systems, fire <br>hydrants, and roads) within the subdivision.

Option (1) is <br>incorrect because a tenancy at will is a tenancy where a tenant, with the consent of the landlord, occupies land for a term which can be terminated by either party at any time. Option (2) is incorrect because a tenancy at sufferance occurs when there is no tenancy because no lease exists, for example, if a tenant does not move out <br>of the leased premises upon the expiration of the term of the lease.

<p>The payment is $49,701, rounded to the next higher dollar. Option (1) is true.</p>

Option (1) is <br>incorrect because actual author ity refers to the authority given to the agent by the principal in their agency <br>agreement and includes express authority, implied authority, and customary authority. Option (2) is incorrect because express authority is the authority created by the terms of the agency contract and does not need to be <br>implied by acts of the parties.

"Duress, in law, consists of:","actual or threatened violence or imprisonment.|difficulty of performance.|undue influence.|a misrepresentation made knowingly or recklessly, not caring whether it be true or false.","<p>Option (1) is correct because common law duress occurs where a person is forced to enter into a contract <br>against his or her will by the threat of imprisonment either to himself or his family, or the threat of actual <br>physical violence. Option (2) is incorrect because difficulty of performance would arise after a contract was <br>entered into, whereas duress relates to the party being robbed of the free will to enter into the contract. Option <br>(3) is incorrect because undue influence is a separate concept from duress. Although it also rel ates to the loss of <br>free will to contract, it is as a result of a person in a superior or dominant position in relation to another using <br>their position to induce the other to enter a contract which he or she would not have otherwise made rather than as a r esult of a threat.

The cost approach of appraisal is NOT generally used to value:,airport hangars.|vacant lots.|condominiums.|single-family residences.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because t he cost approach of appraisal is generally used for unique properties that do not <br>have any comparable sales data, relying on a land value estimate from direct comparison,  then valuing  the <br>improvements on the land with the cost approach. Since vacant land has no improvements the cost approach <br>cannot be used on vacant land.

An agent's authority can be created retroactively by their principal by an action called:,rectification.|ratification.|rescission.|revocation.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because an agent’s authority can be granted retroactively through ratification where an <br>agent enters into a contract on behalf of the principal that is beyond the agent’s authority, but the principal <br>later consents to be bound by the unauthorized acts of the agent. Option (1) is incorrect because rectification occurs when a court corrects an error made by the parties in a contract (or other document) in order to reflect <br>the parties’ true intentions. Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because rescission and revocation are concepts to <br>do with offer and acceptance in contract law rather than agency.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 2,451
Which of the following is NOT an essential requirement of a lease?,The name of the parties|A description of the premises being leased|The rent|The addresses and occupations of the parties,"<p>Option (4) is correct because it is not an essential term  of the lease (whether commercial or residential) to <br>include the occupations of the parties.

In <br>this case, although both parties have made identical offers, neither offer has been accepted by the other party. <br>Joe has not accepted Frank’s offer because he did not have notice of the offer before sending the email to Frank; <br>rather, he has make a separate offer.

"When borrowers increase their maximum allowable loan by accepting a shorter term and a lower interest rate, the borrowers have:","an increased degree of risk regarding changes in the interest rate over time.|the security of never having to incur another set of transaction costs (legal, appraisal) when arranging a new loan with another lender.|a decreased degree of risk regarding changes in the interest rate over time.|committed to paying more interest during the shorter term loan than the longer term loan.","<p>Option (1) is correct because i f borrower agrees  to a shorter term in order to increase the maximum allowable <br>loan, they are exposing themselves to greater risk of change in interest rates. The bor rower may have to <br>refinance the loan at a higher interest rate in the future, which may cause financial distress to the borrower. <br>Option (2) is incorrect because a a borrower, with a higher maximum allowable loan, may still opt to arrange a new loan with a nother lender in the future.

Many, but not all lenders, will set up a separate tax account that the borrower will pay into <br>every periodic payment. This provides security to the lender that their mortgage is the highest priority charge, <br>as well as relieves the borr ower from having to make a lump sum payment for property taxes. This strategy <br>requires additional administration by the lender, so typically smaller or private lenders will leave the property <br>tax payments to the borrower. Option (1) is incorrect because bo rrowers have the obligation to include payment <br>of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Option (3) is incorrect because  there should be a covenant <br>included in the mortgage loan agreement to insure against fire and other hazards for the property .

Option (1) is incorrect, because , Mary may still sell or mortgage her interest without John’s consent as a <br>joint tenant (although doing so will convert the co -ownership to a tenancy in common by severi ng the unity of <br>title ). Option (3) is incorrect because, although married people or people in close relationships often use joint <br>tenancies for tax planning purposes, there is no requirement for married couples who are co -owners of a <br>property to register a s joint tenants in, and they are free to co -own as tenants in common if they prefer to do so.</p>",Correct Option: 2,458
"With respect to commercial tenancies, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is BEST described as which of the following?",An implied covenant that the landlord will refrain and will cause others to refrain from making noise such that it would interfere with the conduct of the tenant's business|An assurance that the tenant will conduct their business in such a manner as to obey all noise bylaws|An assurance that all unfurnished premises be fit for human habitation|An assurance to the tenant against the consequences of a defective title involving the landlord or those lawfully claiming under the landlord,"<p>Option (4) is correct because quiet enjoyment is an assurance to the tenant against the consequences of a <br>defective title, i.e. , it assures  the tenant of the use and enjoyment of the premises for all usual purposes without <br>physical interference or unreasonable disturbance from the landlord.  Option (1) is incorrect because the <br>implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not concern noise that interferes specifically with the tenant’s <br>business. Option (2) is incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is an implied promise given <br>by the landlord to the tenant, and does not restrict the tenant’s own conduct on the property.

Option (2) is false because certain documents that <br>relate to land or land transactions, including listing agreements, are covered by the Act. Option (3) is false <br>because documents that create or transfer interest in land and that require registration to be effective against <br>third parties are specifically excluded from the Act.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 4,461

When a subject clause is wholly subjective, the court may <br>view the arrangement, in law, as nothing more than an offer. Option (2) is incorrect because it describes a <br>condition subsequen t, not a condition precedent.  While a condition subsequent is an event that will discharge <br>the principal obligations of a party to the contract, a condition precedent is an event that must occur before the <br>parties are bound to the contract.

"An offer of $235,000 is accepted, comprised of a cash down payment of $85,000 and a vendor-supplied mortgage loan of $150,000 at 5% per annum, compounded semi-annually. The loan has an amortization period of 25 years, a term of 5 years, and calls for monthly payments rounded up to the next higher dollar. Market rates of interest for equivalent mortgages are currently 8% per annum, compounded semi- annually. The market value of the mortgage is:","$132,849.12|$199,309.00|$235,000.00|$217,849.12","<p>
 First,  calculate the monthly payment and the outstanding balance owing at the end of the 5-year term based on
 the contract rate. Then, calculate the market value of the mortgage based on the contract payment and
 outstanding balance using the market rate of interest. Since the market interest rate is higher than the contract
 rate, the market value of the mortgage will be less than the mortgage amount of $150,000.

Option (1) is incorrect because section 1 of the OLA specifies that there may <br>be more than one occupier of the same premises. Option (2) is incorrect  because section 3 of the OLA states that <br>an occupier has no duty of care in respect of risks willingly assumed by a visitor, other than a duty not to create <br>a danger with intent to do harm to the person or damage to the person’s property, or to act with r eckless <br>disregard to the safety of the person or the integrity of the person’s property.

If the market value of a bedroom is $4,200 and above a 1,900 sq. ft. benchmark, each 100 sq. ft. is worth $5,000, it can be concluded that the subject property has:","5 bedrooms and 2,300 square feet.|4 bedrooms and 2,000 square feet.|3 bedrooms and 2,200 square feet.|5 bedrooms and 2,600 square feet.","<p>Option (4) is correct because t he square foot adjustment for the property is +&#36;15,000.

Option (2) is incorrect because section 6 of the  Interest Act requires that, where a mor tgage <br>requires blended payments, the mortgage document must contain a statement of the interest rate calculated <br>either “yearly or half- yearly not in advance.” Option (3) is incorrect because under section 3 of the  Interest Act , if <br>a document requires inter est to be paid but the rate is not set out, then the rate allocated by law is 5% per <br>annum.

Option (1) is incorrect because a time clause does not, in and of itself, mean that the offer is only open <br>for a stipulated time period . Rather, the right to invoke a time clause arises only where a seller receives a <br>subsequent offer after entering the original contract of purchase and sale.

In other words, a <br>borrower (or the mortgagor) cannot be p revented by the terms of the mortgage from eventually redeeming his <br>or her property free from the conditions contained in the mortgage. An option to purchase a mortgaged <br>property given by the mortgagor (the borrower) to the mortgagee (the lender) at the ti me the mortgage is <br>negotiated, if exercised, would prevent the mortgagor from redeeming his or her property upon repayment, and is therefore void.<br> Option (1) is incorrect because the prohibition against clogging does not disappear even <br>where the mortgagor has independent legal advice. Option (3) is incorrect because a void option cannot be <br>enforceable in any case. Option (4) is incorrect because the equity of redemption refers to a mortgagor’s right to <br>repay the mortgage, and is not a term for an option to repurchase a mortgaged property.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 2,510
"All other things being equal, shortening the contractual term on a constant level payment mortgage always has the effect of:",increasing the size of the periodic payments required to fully amortize the loan.|increasing the size of the outstanding balance payment due at the end of the term.|increasing the interest rate.|increasing the payment frequency.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because if the term of a constant level payment mortgage is shortened, the result will be a <br>higher outstanding balance at the end of the term. This occurs because a shorter term  has fewer payments that <br>will pay down principal and reduce the outstanding balance with each payment. Option (1) is incorrect because <br>the size of periodic payments is not increased when the contractual term in shortened in a constant level <br>payment mortgag e. Option (3) is incorrect because the interest rate is not affected. Option (4) is incorrect <br>because the payment frequency will not change.</p>",Correct Option: 2,511

Any initial appeal against a real property assessment must be submitted to the Property Assessment Review Panel <br>for initial adjudicati on. Option (1) is incorrect because there are no “municipal courts” to deal with property <br>assessment complaints. Option (2) is incorrect because the Court of Appeal will not hear formal complaints <br>regarding assessment notices. The Court of Appeal will only  review issues of law arising from lower court <br>decisions.<br> Option (3) is incorrect because, while the Property Assessment Appeal Board may order the <br>Assessment Commissioner to carry out a reassessment, formal complaints are not made to the Commissioner.</p>",Correct Option: 4,512
"Charlie enters into a fixed term tenancy agreement with Lucy for the rental of a suite during the school year. The agreement is for eight months beginning on September 1, 2018. The agreement does not provide that Charlie must vacate the rental unit when the term expires. In April, Charlie finds a summer job and decides to remain in the suite after the original lease expires. He pays Lucy one month's rent on May 1, 2019, which she accepts. No new agreement is entered into. Two days later, Lucy learns that her brother, Linus, has been transferred back to Vancouver and is expected to arrive at the end of the month with his new wife, Sally. Linus has indicated that he wishes to live in the suite now occupied by Charlie. Which of the following statements is TRUE?","Under the termination provisions of the Residential Tenancy Act, Lucy can give Charlie notice of the end of the tenancy agreement since she intends, in good faith, for her brother to occupy the premises.|Lucy just has to wait until the end of May, and can evict Charlie at any time after that, since the original fixed term lease has expired and there is no new tenancy agreement.|If Linus decides to purchase the suite, and Lucy provides Charlie with at least two months' notice and pays an amount equivalent to one months' rent, Linus must move in within a reasonable time after the effective date of the notice and stay for at least 6 months or else a court may order that Charlie be paid an amount equivalent to 12 months' rent.|If Linus decides to purchase the suite and plans to move in right away, Lucy can give at least one month notice to end the tenancy.","<p>Option (3) is correct because under the Residential Tenancy Act , when a fixed term residential tenancy expires <br>and the agreement does not provide that the tenant will vacate the rental unit when the term expires, the <br>landlord and the te nant are presumed to have renewed the original agreement as a month -to-month tenancy. <br>Section 49 of the Residential Tenancy Act  allows a landlord to terminate a tenancy agreement where the <br>landlord enters into a good faith agreement to sell the rental unit  and the purchaser intends to occupy that unit, <br>provided that each of the conditions laid out in Option (3) are met. If the purchaser does not occupy the unit as <br>intended for at least six months, the purchaser must pay the tenant an amount equivalent to 12  months’ rent.  <br>Option (1) is incorrect because a landlord cannot terminate a tenancy agreement to allow his or her sibling to <br>occupy the rental unit  without further justification.  There is a provision for a “close family member” but <br>siblings do not fall un der that category.  <br>Option (2) is incorrect because, as previously mentioned, Lucy and Linus are presumed to have renewed the <br>original agreement as a month- to-month tenancy.  In order to end the tenancy, Lucy must be able to rely on a <br>provision in the Reside ntial Tenancy Act which allows her to do so. Unfortunately, in Lucy’s situation, Charlie <br>is her brother an d not a “close family member”. Even if Charlie was a “close family member”, Lucy would need <br>to provide two months’ notice.  <br>Option (4) is incorrect bec ause Lucy would need to provide at least two months’ notice to end the tenancy.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 3,513

Option (1) is incorrect because the offeree is <br>the party accepting the offer. Option (2) is incorrect because, if an offer is made by mail, acceptance need not be received by the offeror to be effective.

"Where a borrower believes that the amount of interest being charged is excessive, under which statute might relief be granted?",The Interest Act|The Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act|The Land Titles Act|All of the above,"<p>Option (2) is correct because, in British Columbia, the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act  gives <br>courts the power to grant relief where a mortgage transaction is deemed inequitable, or where the cost of a loan <br>is excessive and the transaction is harsh and unconscionable. Option (1) in incorrect because the federal <br>Interest Act does not impose a limit on the rate of interest which can be charged in a mortgage transaction. <br>Option (3) is incorrect because the Land Title Act does not provide for relief for excessive mortgage interest <br>rates.

"As a marketing incentive to speed up the sale of newly completed but unsold condominiums, a developer agrees to provide the buyers with first mortgages written at 8% rather than the going market rate of 13%, if they pay the $45,000 asking price.

The general rule regarding patent <br>defects is that the buyer assum es the risk ( caveat emptor ), meaning that the seller  and the listing licensee  are <br>not required to disclose discoverable defects . Option (1) is incorrect because, while it can be prudent to do so, <br>neither the seller nor the seller’s agent has a duty to insp ect the premises prior to advertising it for sale.

An advantage of this is that it eliminates certain <br>inefficiencies, such as time spent commuting to and from the office, which allows representatives more time to focus on more productive, income -generating tasks. Option (1) is incorrect because due to decentralization, it is <br>more difficult, not easier, to establish a sense of community within the brokerage in a mobile office environment.

Option (1) is incorrect because a lender may require a guaranto r as a form of additional <br>security for the loan. Option (2) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act  provides that a lender can obtain <br>the right to vote at meetings of the strata corporation on matters relating to insurance, maintenance, finance or other matters affecting the security of the mortgage. Option (3) is incorrect because lenders are generally given <br>complete discretion to select from the available remedies. This ensures that lenders are given the greatest <br>possible chance to recover their loss es resulting from a borrower default. <br></p>",Correct Option: 4,542
"Conditions precedent are usually included in contracts of purchase and sale to protect the buyer. However, since conditions precedent can also be abused by buyers, a seller must be protected when a condition precedent is being included in a contract of purchase and sale. Which of the following additions to the contract of purchase and sale is NOT a valid method of protecting a seller's interests?","A specific time within which the condition must be removed can be included in the contract of purchase and sale.|A clause requiring a Property Disclosure Statement to be filled out can be included in the contract of purchase and sale.|A covenant can be inserted stating that the buyer will use their best efforts to satisfy the specific condition.|A time clause can be included, which gives the seller the right to demand that the buyer remove the condition precedent within 72 hours.","<p>Option (2) is correct because it is in the buyer’s (not the seller’s) best interests to incorporate a Property <br>Disclosure Statement (PDS) into the contract of purchase and sale. Doing so incorporates the warranties made <br>by the seller in the PDS into the co ntract of purchase and sale, which allows the buyer to sue the seller for <br>breach of contract if such warranties are breached. Option (1) is incorrect because it allows the seller to review <br>the buyer’s progress with regards to the fulfilment of the conditio n and decide whether or not to extend the <br>time limit or to terminate the agreement. Option (3) is incorrect because if such a covenant is inserted into the <br>contract of purchase and sale, and the buyer does not use his or her best efforts to satisfy the spe cific condition, <br>the seller can sue the buyer for breach of contract. Option (4) is incorrect because a including a 72 -hour “time <br>clause” allows the seller to demand that the buyer remove the condition precedent within 72 hours in the event that the seller  receives another offer. If the buyer fails to do so, then the seller can accept the other offer.</p>",Correct Option: 2,543

Option (1) is false because the comparable property can be used as <br>evidence of market value, as long as an adjustment is made for the “ cheap ” financing provided by the vendor. <br>Option (2) is false because the comparable sale price must be ad justed downward to compensate for the benefit <br>provided by the below -market interest rate on the mortgage. Option (3) is false because the price of the <br>comparable property needs to be adjusted to its cash- equivalent price.</p>",Correct Option: 4,544

"Norm Abrahm has offered $231,000 for a house, providing he is able to obtain acceptable financing. The house lists for $242,000, but the lender has appraised the house at $238,000. The lender requires a loan- to-value ratio of 80% and a gross debt service ratio of 28%. Property taxes are $1,750 per year and Mr. Abrahm's annual gross income is $85,000.

To answer this question, calculate the maximum amount of money that can be lent out given the two

the loan-to-value constraint and then calculate the loan amount for the GDSR constraint. In order to determine
the maximum amount that the lender will advance, choose the lesser of the two results.

",Correct Option: 3,547
Which of the following clauses contained in a mortgage would constitute a clog on the equity of redemption and therefore be void?,Collateral advantage clause|Option to purchase clause|Indemnity clause|Acceleration clause,"<p>Option (2) is correct because an option to purchase clause, if exercised, would de ny the borrower his or her <br>right to redeem title to the property upon repayment of the loan. In other words, if the bank exercised the option and chose to purchase the property, then the borrower would necessarily be unable to redeem title upon <br>repayment. Option (1) is incorrect because collateral advantage clauses are no longer considered clogs on the <br>borrower’s equity of redemption, even if they extend beyond the term of the mortgage. Option (3) is incorrect <br>because indemnity clauses do not constitute clo gs on the equity of redemption, and are instead rendered <br>unenforceable by section 8(1) of the federal <br>Interest Act . Option (4) is incorrect because an acceleration clause is <br>a term in the mortgage contract which makes the outstanding balance of the loan im mediately due and payable <br>if the borrower defaults. Acceleration clauses do not interfere with the borrower’s right to redeem title upon <br>repayment, since they operate in situations where the borrower has defaulted.</p>",Correct Option: 2,548
The MOST effective remedy available to a landlord when a tenant does not pay the rent in a commercial tenancy is:,an injunction.|a garnishing order.|distress.|a demand letter.,"<p>Option (3) is correct because the remedy of distress allows a commercial landlord to seize and sell a tenant’s <br>personal property in order to satisfy a claim for rent owing. This is the most effective remedy because it <br>immediately gives the landlord tangible assets which can be sold to recover the debt. Option (1) is incorrect <br>because a tenant may choose to disobey an injunction, which would require that the landlord take additional <br>legal action against them. Option (2) is incorrect because the third party to whom the gar nishing order is served <br>may still disobey the garnishing order. There are also additional limitations to this remedy, including a limit on <br>the percentage that may be garnished from an employee’s wages. Option (4) is incorrect because a demand letter may be  ignored by the tenant, in which case the landlord would be required to pursue additional action.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 3,549
Where an agent with authority enters into a contract with a third party and does not disclose that they are acting as an agent:,the third party may sue either the agent or the principal to enforce the contract.|the principal may sue the agent to enforce the contract.|only the agent may sue the third party to enforce the contract.|there is no contract in existence because there is no disclosure.,"<p>Option (1) is correct because, at common law, where an agent does not disclose to a third party that he or she is <br>acting as an agent, t he agent may be held liable as a principal. This rule is justified because the third party was <br>led to believe that it was making a contract with the agent personally, and might not have chosen to enter a contract with the principal had they been aware of t he principal’s existence and/or identity. Option (2) is <br>incorrect because the contract is not between the agent and the principal, but is instead between the principal <br>and the third party (though the agent may be held liable as a principal, as mentioned pr eviously). Option (3) is <br>incorrect because the contract remains between the principal and the third party, and therefore, the principal <br>may sue the third party to enforce it. Option (4) is incorrect because an agent’s failure to disclose their status as <br>an agent does not render a contract void.</p>",Correct Option: 1,550

A licensee who breaches this prohibition may be suspended by the <br>British Columbia Financial Services Authority.

Option (1) is incorrect because any rezoning bylaw must be given four <br>readings by the municipal council, meaning that the council must vote in favour of the bylaw four separate times. Option (3) is incorrect because subdivision bylaws, made under the <br>Local Government Act , may require <br>that an owner dedicate up to five percent of his or her land for park purposes. In addition, sometimes an applicant will be required to pay for the widening of roads. Option (4) is incorrect because after a proposed <br>rezonin g bylaw receives a favourable first (or sometimes second) reading, a public hearing is usually held.

This means that if the landlord, or anyone who claims to have received rights from the landlord, <br>attacks the tenant’s right to the premises, it would breach this covenant. Option (1) is incorrect because the <br>implied covenant of quiet enjoyment does not concern competition with the tenant’s business. Option (2) is <br>incorrect because the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is an implied promise given by the landlord to the <br>tenant, and does not restrict the tenant’s own conduct on the property.

An agent's duty to the principal not to make a secret profit means that an agent must keep the principal fully informed about which of the following?,All of the agent's personal business dealings|The agent's annual tax return|All of the actual benefits and prospective benefits accruing to the agent as a result of the agency relationship|Only the actual profits received by the agent,"<p>Option (3) is correct because an agent owes a duty of loyalty to the principal, which requires them to disclose to <br>the principal all facts relevant to the transaction within the agent’s knowledge. The complete disclosure <br>requirement prohibits an agent from making a “secret” profit, meaning that the agent must disclose all of the benefits and prospective benefits received by the agent as a result of, or in the course of, performing duties on <br>behalf o f the principal. Option (1) is incorrect because the agent is not required to disclose all of their personal <br>business dealings to the principal if those dealings do not affect the interests of the principal. Option (2) is <br>incorrect because the agent is not  required to inform the principal of their own annual tax return, as this <br>information does not affect the interests of the principal. Option (4) is incorrect because an agent has a duty to <br>disclose all relevant facts that could influence the conduct of the  principal. This duty is not limited to situations <br>where the agent is receiving actual profits, and extends to situations where the agent will suffer a loss .</p>",Correct Option: 3,561
"In appraising an income-producing property using the income approach, gross potential rents must be estimated. How are gross potential rents BEST determined?",Based on long-term vacancy rates in the area in which the subject property is located|Based on published surveys of relevant real estate trends|Based on the relationship between money actually received and units actually rented|Based on current market rents of similar properties,"<p>Option (4) is correct because g ross potential revenue is estimated using current market rents paid on similar <br>properties. Even when the subject or comparable property is fully rented, the rents used in determining the property ’s net operating income should be compared to current rental prices.  Therefore, Options (1), (2), and (3)  <br>are incorrect.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 4,562
When a strata corporation grants an owner or tenant of a strata lot the permission to exclusively use common property as a short term exclusive use:,"the permission requires approval by a Ã‚Â¾ vote at a general meeting of the strata corporation, unless the short term exclusive use is to endure for less than six months.|the permission may be granted by a majority vote of the strata council if the permission does not involve a significant change in the use or appearance of the common property.|the permission is identical to the designation of limited common property for the benefit of a strata lot owner.|the strata corporation must not grant the permission for more than one month.","<p>Option (2) is correct because the Strata Property Act  gives strata corporations the ability to grant an owner or <br>tenant permission to exclusively use common property for a period of less than one year. If the permissi on does <br>not involve a significant change in the use or appearance of the common property, then the permission can be <br>granted by a majority vote of the strata council. Option (1) is incorrect because approval by a ¾ vote, rather than <br>a simple majority vote,  at a general meeting of the strata corporation is only required where the permission or <br>privilege granted involves a significant change in the use or appearance of the property. Option (3) is incorrect because permission to exclusively use common property  may only be granted for less than one year, whereas <br>the designation of limited common property has no fixed duration and need not be renewed. Therefore, the <br>permission to exclusively use common property cannot be identical to the designation of limited co mmon <br>property. Option (4) is incorrect because the strata corporation may grant the permission for up to one year.</p>",Correct Option: 2,563
Which one of the following is NOT an activity of a Board of Variance?,To permit a structural alteration to a building used for a non-conforming use|To hear an appeal where the enforcement of a zoning bylaw will cause undue hardship|To amend a zoning bylaw|To establish a time limit within which construction of a minor variance must be completed,"<p>Option (3) is correct because a Board of Variance does not have the jurisdiction to amend zoning bylaws.  <br>Instead, the function of a Board of Variance is to permit minor exceptions, or “variances”, to existing bylaws, <br>without altering the bylaws themselves.  Amending zoning bylaws is the responsibility of municipal councils <br>and regional districts.  Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect because a Board of Variance is given the authority to <br>hear appeals in situations where the enforcement of a bylaw would cause undue hardship.  To achieve this <br>purpose, the Board may permit a structural alteration to a building used for a non -conforming use, and may <br>establish time limits within which construction of a variance must be completed.</p>",Correct Option: 3,564
The REALTORÃ‚Â® Code of Ethics is enforced by the:,Canadian Real Estate Association.|local real estate boards.|British Columbia Real Estate Association.|British Columbia Financial Services Authority.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because the REALTOR® Code of Ethics is enforced by the local real estate boards in British <br>Columbia. Option  (1) is incorrect because, while the Canadian Real Estate Association establishes the <br>REALTOR® Code of Ethics, enforcement occurs at the local board level. Option (3) is incorrect because the <br>British Columbia Real Estate Association is responsible for repr esenting the interests of local real estate boards, <br>and their members on provincial matters, and does not directly enforce the REALTOR® Code of Ethics. Option <br>(4) is incorrect because the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (“BCFSA”)  is a statuto ry body tasked <br>with administering the Real Estate Services Act  (RESA) and related regulations, and rules. The REALTOR® Code <br>of Ethics is set by the Canadian Real Estate Association, which is a professional trade organization that is separate from BCFSA .</p>",Correct Option: 2,565
Which of the following information is NOT necessary for a brokerage to keep in the real estate trade record sheet?,The date of the MLSÃ‚Â® listing|The sale price or other consideration for the trade in real estate|The nature of the trade in real estate|The names and addresses of all parties to the trade in real estate,"<p>Option (1) is correct because a real estate trade record sheet is required for each transaction in which the brokerage or a related licensee holds or receives money. Since listing a property on the MLS<br>® listing occurs <br>prior to such a transaction, this information does not need to be included in the record sheet. Options (2), (3), <br>and (4) are incorrect because each contains information that is necessary to accurately describe and record real <br>estate transa ctions.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 1,566
Sections 15 and 18(1) of the Manufactured Home Act provide that no person shall move a manufactured home UNLESS:,"the manufactured home is registered in the land titles office.|the manufactured home is registered in the manufactured homes registry, and a transport permit has been obtained from the registrar.|the manufactured home is free of any security interests registered against it in the personal property registry.|they are the registered owner of the manufactured home.","<p>Option (2) is correct because section 15 of the Manufactured Home Act  provides that no person may move a <br>manufactured home unless it is registered in the manufactured homes registry. Additionally, section 18(1) <br>requires that a transport permit be obtained from the registrar to authorize the movement of the home to a <br>specific location. Option (1) is incorrect because the ownership, transfer and granting of charges of <br>manufactured homes are not registered in the land title office. Option (3) is incorrect because a manufactured <br>home with a security interest registered against it in the personal property registry can still be moved. The <br>secured party remains protected because registrar is required to notify the secured party when a n application <br>for a transport permit is made. Option (4) is incorrect because, in certain cases, a landlord, a secured party, or <br>any other person acting under a court order may obtain a transport permit authorizing them to move a <br>manufactured home.</p>",Correct Option: 2,567
"Bert and Ernie owned, as joint tenants, a revenue producing property, which was leased to Oscar. Ernie died, leaving a will, which gave his interest in the property to Grover. Grover is now demanding one-half of the rent paid by Oscar. Bert refuses this request. Which of the following statements is TRUE?","Bert and Grover now own the revenue producing property as joint tenants.|Bert and Grover now own the revenue producing property as tenants in common.|No interest in the property could be transferred to Grover via Ernie's will because the entire estate passed to Bert when Ernie died.|Ernie severed the joint tenancy by bequeathing his interest in the property to Grover. Therefore, Grover is entitled to a one-half interest in the property.","<p>Option (3) in correct because joint tenants enjoy the right of survivorship, meaning that when one joint tenant <br>dies, the entire estate automatically vests in the surviving joint tenant(s). Bert, therefore, became the sole owner <br>of the reve nue producing property immediately upon Ernie’s death and Ernie had no interest to dispose of in <br>his will. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because no interest in the property passed to Grover. Option (4) is incorrect because a joint tenant cannot sever a  joint tenancy merely by bequeathing their interest in the <br>property to a third party in their will. To sever the joint tenancy Ernie would have had to (a) destroy one of the four “unities” required for a joint tenancy to exist (e.g. , by selling or mortgagi ng his estate); (b) partition the <br>property via a mutual agreement with Bert; or (c) obtain a court order for partition.</p>",Correct Option: 3,568
There are three common types of void deeds. Which one is considered NOT to be a void deed?,An unregistered deed|A forged deed|A deed given for illegal consideration|A deed signed in circumstances where the party can plead non est factum,"<p>Option (1) is correct because section 20(1) of the Land Title Act  provides that “except as against the person <br>mak ing it”, an unregistered transfer deed is inoperative. This section indicates that an unregistered deed <br>remains operative between the transferor and the transferee. Option (2) is incorrect because it is a long standing <br>common law rule that a forged deed is  void from the beginning. Option (3) is incorrect because, where the <br>consideration given exchange for a deed amounts to an illegal act or thing, the transfer deed is void. Option (4) <br>is incorrect because where a party can successfully plead non est factum (“that is not my deed”) the deed in <br>question will be rendered void for reason of unilateral mistake.</p>",Correct Option: 1,569
Which one of the following is FALSE with respect to the proprietorship form of business?,A proprietorship is terminated upon the death of the owner.|A proprietor must pay tax on their business income at personal tax rates.|The proprietor is liable for all debts of their business to the extent of their capital investment in the business only.|There is no legal separation of the assets of the business and the other assets of its owner.,"<p>Option (3) is correct because, since a sole proprietorship is a business enterprise owned by a single individual, <br>the owner of a pro prietorship is personally liable for all the debts incurred by the proprietorship. This means <br>that, if the proprietorship is unable to pay its debts, the proprietorship’s creditors may collect from the personal <br>assets of the owner. Option (1) is incorrect because, since a proprietorship is not regarded as a separate legal <br>entity from the owner, it is terminated upon the death of the owner. Option (2) is incorrect because the profits of <br>a proprietorship accrue to the owner and are taxed as part of his or her  personal income. Option (4) is incorrect <br>because, as stated previously, a proprietorship is not regarded as a separate legal entity from the owner, and the <br>owner has unlimited liability.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 3,570
"Hurston, the Head of Production at XYZ Preservatives Ltd., has been ordered by the company's president, in Toronto, to vent some gasses that have been stored in a pressure chamber at the Vancouver plant. Although the president knows that the gas is highly toxic, Hurston has been assured by the president that the gas is totally harmless and will quickly dissipate when released. Unfortunately, having escaped from the pressure chamber, the gas drifts in a dense cloud over Ralph's neighbouring apple orchard and destroys the apple crop. Which one of the following is TRUE?",Ralph will be successful in a claim against XYZ's president under the doctrine of trespass.|Ralph will probably succeed in a claim against XYZ based on negligence.|Ralph will be successful in his claim against XYZ based on XYZ breaching its fiduciary duty towards Ralph.|Ralph would probably have a successful claim against XYZ based on the provisions of the Occupiers Liability Act.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because Ralph will like ly be able to establish the three elements required for a successful <br>negligence claim: (1) that XYZ, a company storing highly toxic gasses, owed him a duty of care as his neighbour; <br>(2) that XYZ breached the standard of care by allowing the gas to drift ov er Ralph’s apple orchard; and (3) that <br>the damage to Ralph’s orchard was reasonably foreseeable (i.e. not too remote). Option (1) is incorrect because <br>trespass is an intentional tort, and consequently must be a direct, voluntary act, as opposed to an indir ect result <br>of an act. In this case, there is no indication that Hurston or the President intended to release the gas over <br>Ralph’s apple orchard. Option (3) is incorrect because a fiduciary duty is only owed by a person who holds a <br>legally significant posit ion of trust with respect to someone else, and is obliged, by virtue of that relationship or <br>trust, to act solely for the other person’s benefit. There is no indication, on the facts provided, that XYZ was in <br>such a relationship of trust with Ralph. Option  (4) is incorrect because the Occupiers Liability Act  would only <br>apply if Ralph had suffered damage while on XYZ’s premises.</p>",Correct Option: 2,571
"Under the Residential Tenancy Act, the landlord is entitled to collect a security deposit equal to:",one half of one month's rent.|one month's rent.|the first and last month's rent.|six months' rent.,"<p>Option (1) is correct because the Regulations passed under the Residential Tenancy Act  provide that a secur ity <br>deposit for a residential tenancy agreement cannot exceed one half of the monthly rent. Options (2), (3), and (4) <br>are incorrect because each of these amounts exceeds the amount permitted under the Act.</p>",Correct Option: 1,572

"When casual reference is made to the current mortgage lending rate, the common practice is to quote:",effective annual interest rates.|nominal interest rates.|equivalent interest rates.|interest rates per compounding period.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because w hen mortgage interest rates are casually referenced, it is typically a nominal <br>interest rate.

"Charlotte offered to sell her property to Dennis for $180,000 by email. Dennis emailed, ""Send lowest cash price - will give $165,000 cash"". Charlotte replied, ""Cannot reduce price"". Dennis then accepted the original offer but Charlotte refused to sell claiming that there was no contract. Which of the following statements is TRUE?","There is no contract because Charlotte's reply was not a renewal of her original offer.|Charlotte's reply to Dennis' first wire was, in effect, a counter-offer on the same terms as her original offer.|Charlotte may successfully claim that her initial price of $180,000 was an ""invitation to treat"" and therefore she was entitled to refuse Dennis' offer to pay that amount.|Options (1) and (3) are both true.","<p>Option (2) is correct because Charlotte effectively revived her original offer (to sell her property to Dennis for <br>&#36;180,000), which Dennis then accepted. Dennis’ offer of &#36;165,000 was a counter -offer, which therefore <br>terminated the original offer. However,  Charlotte made her own counter -offer when she replied, “cannot reduce <br>price”, which effectively renewed her original offer. Option (1) is incorrect because the case of Livingstone v. <br>Evans tells us that the words “cannot reduce price”, uttered in this con text, renew the original offer. Dennis was <br>therefore entitled to accept the renewed offer. Option (3) is incorrect because Charlotte’s initial email contained the necessary terms (the property and the price) to constitute an offer capable of being accepted , and therefore <br>was more than a mere invitation to treat. O ption (4) is incorrect because O ptions (1) and (3) are both incorrect.</p>",Correct Option: 2,575

"Anna is interested in purchasing Elizabeth's house. In an attempt to save money, instead of hiring a licensed home inspector, Anna thoroughly inspects Elizabeth's house herself and does not find any defects or deficiencies. After the sale completes, Anna discovers a major issue with the foundation of the house that will cost $55,000 to fix. As a result, Anna sues Elizabeth for failing to disclose the issue with the foundation. Which of the following is TRUE?","Because the deficiency in the foundation is a major issue, Elizabeth is liable to Anna, even if she did not know about the defect.|Elizabeth would only be required to disclose this defect if Anna specifically asked about the foundation.|Anna's claim against Elizabeth for failing to disclose the foundation issue will likely fail if it can be shown that any qualified home inspector would have identified the issue.|The foundation issue is known as a property stigma.","<p>Option (3) is correct because if a qualified home inspector would have identified the issue, it would likely be <br>classified as a patent defect, which sellers do not have an obligat ion to disclose. As a buyer, Anna has a duty to <br>conduct a reasonable inspection and make reasonable inquiries to ensure that there are no patent defects, which typically involves consulting a licensed home inspector. Option (1) is incorrect because, even for major <br>issues, the seller is only required to disclose latent defects that he or she knows or should have reasonably <br>known. Option (2) is incorrect because sellers are required to disclose known latent defects that render the <br>property dangerous or unfit for habitation, even if the buyer did not specifically ask about that defect. Option <br>(4) is incorrect because the defect’s impact on the property can be objectively determined at a value of &#36;55,000 <br>and therefore cannot be classified as a stigma.</p>",Correct Option: 3,577
"On June 1, Jem offered to buy Boo's summer cottage for $230,000, and Boo accepted. Since the cottage was on a secluded island, neither party was aware that on May 30, the cottage was struck by lightning and completely destroyed by fire. Boo has no insurance and is seeking to enforce the contract. Which of the following statements is TRUE?","This is an example of mutual mistake and Jem can rescind the contract.|The doctrine of frustration applies here and both parties are relieved of their future obligations under the contract.|A court will set aside the contract based on ""non est factum"" (it is not my deed) or unilateral mistake since Jem did not know the nature of the document he was signing and could not have known the cottage was no longer standing.|This is an example of common mistake and the contract is void.","<p>Option (4) is correct because a common mistake occurs when both parties to a contract make the same mistake about a fundamental term of the contract, such as the existence of what is being sold. In this case, the fact that <br>the cottage had bee n destroyed prior to the formation of the contract was unknown to both parties. The <br>existence of a common mistake such as this renders a contract void. Option (1) is incorrect because a mutual <br>mistake occurs when both parties make a fundamental mistake abo ut the contract but each makes a different <br>mistake. Here, the mistake was the same (the assumption that the cottage still existed). Option (2) is incorrect <br>because frustration occurs where a specific thing that is necessary for the performance of the contr act is no <br>longer in existence at the time for performance. In this case, the cottage was destroyed before the contract was <br>entered into, meaning that frustration does not apply. Option (3) is incorrect because (a) there is no indication that Jem did not un derstand the nature of the contract of sale; and (b) the mistake regarding the existence of the <br>cottage was a common mistake, not a unilateral mistake since both Jem and Boo were mistaken.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 4,578
Which of the following is a FALSE statement regarding the duties licensees owe to their clients under the Real Estate Services Rules?,The duty to act in the client's best interests does not include taking actions that are unlawful.|The duty to act within the scope of authority given by the client does not include signing agreements for the client unless written permission is received.|The duty of confidentiality is terminated when the relationship between the licensee and the client ends.|The duty of full disclosure can include disclosing information a licensee may see as trivial.,"<p>Option (3) is correct because it is false. The duty of confidentiality to a client lasts forever. Option (1) is incorrect <br>because actions that are unlawful would be against the duty of acting in the client’s best interest. Option (2) is <br>incorrect because s ection 45 of the Real Estate  Services  Rules  requires licensees to obtain written authorization <br>to sign agreements on behalf of their clients. Option (4) is incorrect because full disclosure requires licensees <br>disclose to their clients all known material in formation, no matter how trivial .</p>",Correct Option: 3,579

A mortgage of the mortgagor's equity of redemption is called:,a lien.|an equitable mortgage.|an agreement for sale.|a lease.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because a borrower who grants a legal mortgage retains an equitable interest in the property. The bor rower is free to mortgage this equitable interest by granting a second, or subsequent, <br>mortgage. These subsequent mortgages are mortgages on the borrower’s equity of redemption (the borrower’s right to repay the mortgage and redeem title to the property). Option (1) is incorrect because, though also a form <br>of security interest, a lien is not a mortgage.

The Court Order usually obtained first in a foreclosure action is an:,order nisi.|order absolute.|order for sale.|order for specific performance.,"<p>Option (1) is correct because, at the fir st court appearance where a claim for foreclosure is brought, a judge will <br>generally grant an order nisi. The order nisi is an important preliminary step because it sets the final <br>redemption period, during which the respondents can redeem the mortgage by paying the amount due and <br>owing. Options (2) and (3) are incorrect because orders absolute and orders for sale may be obtained if payment is not made within the redemption period set by the order nisi. Option (4) is incorrect because an order for <br>specific p erformance may be available in the case of an agreement for sale, but is not an available remedy for <br>foreclosure actions.</p>",Correct Option: 1,584
Which one of the following is a liability on a financial statement?,Accumulated depreciation|Mortgages payable|Wages paid|Prepaid expense,"<p>Option (2) is correct because mortgages payable represents a debt that must be repaid. Option (1) is incorrect <br>because a ccumulated depreciation is part of the assets section on the balance sheet, and takes away from the <br>value of the depreciable asset(s). Options (3) and (4) are incorrect because w ages paid is listed as an expense, <br>and prepaid expenses are listed as  a current asset.</p>",Correct Option: 2,585

<p>
The yield to the lender is below the loan’s interest rate 
(j<sub>12</sub> = 4.75%), which is the expected result given the payments 
are sufficient to pay off a $350,000 loan, but the lender is actually advancing 
<b>$357,000</b> (2% × $350,000 + $350,000). Therefore, the lender is being slightly underpaid 
with each payment.

Assume that the lender demands a 25-year amortization period and monthly payments at a contract rate of j  = 4.2%.

 To calculate the maximum loan amount, calculate the loan amounts based on both the constraint of the loan-to-value ratio and the gross debt service ratio. The loan -to-value is calculated based on the bank’s appraisal of the pro perty. In this case, the amount the bank appraises the property at is $275,000. Once the payments from the GDSR are calculated, the PV of the loan is calculated, taking into consideration the stress test qualification rules. The loan amount that satisfies both constraints (the smaller amount) will be the maximum loan amount.</p>

"Jennifer Joseph has lived alone in an apartment since the death of her husband 10 years ago. She has just turned 60 years of age, retired from her job as a bus driver, and wants to begin gardening as a hobby to fill in her retirement years. She has found a small house that is selling at a price she can afford because it is the only residential property in an area of commercial development. The present owners, who are anxious to sell, have lived in the house for about 20 years and have developed a magnificent garden, which appeals very much to Mrs. Joseph; however, she is worried about having enough retirement income to meet the mortgage payments and the property tax payments if she uses all of her savings as a down payment. Which one of the following statements is TRUE?","Mrs. Joseph should apply for a reverse annuity mortgage (RAM) because a RAM will require lower mortgage payments than a conventional mortgage.|After Mrs. Joseph's purchase, the property will continue to have an assessed value for real property tax purposes, which is based on its value as a residential property.|Mrs. Joseph may make application to defer payment of the net property tax under the regular program for as many years as she owns and resides in the house.|If Mrs. Joseph becomes an owner-occupier, the home owner grants will allow reduction of her taxes to no more than $350.","<p>Option (3) is correct because British Columbia’s regular tax deferral program will allow Mrs. Joseph to make an <br>application to defer up to 100% of the net property taxes payable on the property, since it will be here principal <br>place of residence. Assuming that Mrs. Joseph is either a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident, and that she <br>would have a minimum equity of 25% in the property if she purchased it, she would likely qualify for the <br>regular program given that she is both 55 and a widow. Option (1) is incorrect because a reverse annuity <br>mortgage is a type of mortgage that can function to supplement the income of aged persons who already own their home, not as a way to reduce mortgage payments where a new home is being purchased. Option (2) is <br>incorrec t because the property is the only residential property in an area of commercial development. While <br>section 19(8) of the <br>Assessment Act permits certain residential properties to be assessed according to the value <br>based solely on their current residential use, Mrs. Joseph would not qualify for this special assessment because <br>she has not lived continuously in the residence for ten years.

"A central gas fired, forced hot water heating system with room baseboard units provides MOST of its heat transfer in which one of the following ways?",Convection|Combustion|Collection|Radiation,"<p>Option (1) is  correct because convection heat transfer occurs when the baseboard heating unit warms the air in <br>the room. As the air around the baseboard unit warms, the warmer air rises and cooler air falls, creating a <br>convective current in the room.

There is no licensing <br>requirement for persons like Alan, who perform real estate services without receiving or expecting any money <br>or reward. Option (1) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (3) is incorrect because “real estate services” are <br>not limited to the writing of the contract of purchase and sale. The Real Estate Services Act  defines “real estate <br>services” as in cluding actions such as advising on the appropriate price for real estate, making representations <br>about a property, finding a party to acquire real estate, showing the real estate, and negotiating the price of real estate. Therefore, Alan may not perform a ny of these services (or any other service included in the definition of <br>“trading services”) and receive money for it.

Which of the following statements regarding joint tenancy is FALSE?,"Where a husband and wife own property in joint tenancy and one of them dies, the other becomes the owner of the whole interest.|Where a joint tenant transfers their interest to a third party, the third party becomes a tenant in common with the original joint tenant.|Where a husband and wife own property as tenants in common and one of them dies, the other becomes the owner of the whole interest.|A joint tenancy becomes a tenancy in common upon severance.","<p>Option (3) is correct because there is no right of survivorship in a tenancy in common. Therefore, where two people own property as tenants in common, they each may leave their interest by will to whomever they wish. <br>Option (1) is incorrect because the essential feature of joint tenancy is the right of survivorship. This means that <br>when one joint tenant dies, the property automatically v ests in the surviving joint tenant(s). Option (2) is <br>incorrect because all joint tenants must receive their interests at the same time and from the same document. <br>Therefore, if one joint tenant transfers his interest to a third party, both the unity of tim e and the unity of title <br>are destroyed, and the co -ownership is converted to a tenancy in common.

In a pure Torrens system, no mention of a trust can appear on the register. Option (1) is incorrect because a caveat is a short -term notice registered against a title to <br>land warning those looking at the title that a claim for an estate or interest in the property has been made. <br>Option (2) is incorrect because a <br>lis pendens  is a term previously used for what is now called a certificate of <br>pending litigation.

Mark told him that there were no termite infestation problems in the house. After the sale was completed, John discovered that the house had a serious termite problem, which would cost a considerable amount to repair. On what grounds might Mark be liable to John in a lawsuit?",Occupier's liability|Private nuisance|Negligent misrepresentation|Vicarious liability,"<p>Option (3) is correct because the four requirements for an action for negligent misrepresentation ar e met: (1) <br>Mark made an untrue statement when he told John that there was no termite problem; (2) the statement was likely negligent because, assuming that Mark was not outright lying, he failed to ascertain the necessary <br>information regarding the termites  before telling John that there was no infestation; (3) as an experienced <br>professional giving advice to a person (John) who would reasonably rely on that advice, Mark owed John a duty <br>of care; and (4) given the position of Mark, a real estate licensee show ing a home, it was likely reasonable for <br>John to rely on Mark’s statement. Since these four elements are likely met, Mark is likely liable to John for the <br>repairs on the grounds of negligent misrepresentation. Option (1) is incorrect because John did not s uffer loss <br>while Mark was showing him the home. Option (2) is incorrect because private nuisance occurs where an owner <br>or occupier of land unreasonably or substantially interferes with the reasonable use and enjoyment of a <br>neighbouring property. Option (4)  is incorrect because vicarious liability is the principle that renders <br>employers liable for wrongful acts committed by their employees. In this case, vicarious liability may render <br>Mark’s real estate brokerage liable for his negligent misrepresentation.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 3,615
Which of the following statements is TRUE with respect to security deposits in a commercial tenancy?,The interest that accrues on a security deposit is always paid to the account of the landlord.|Someone who purchases the property from the landlord is obligated to repay the security deposit to the tenant.|The amount of a security deposit may be freely negotiated between the two parties to a commercial lease.|All of the above,"<p>Option (3) is correct because there are no legal restrictions regarding security deposits in commercial tenancies. <br>This amount is left open to negotiation. Option (1) is incorrect because the allocation of interest on security <br>deposits in commercial tenanc ies is open for negotiation, and therefore may be allocated to the tenant. <br>Additionally, the Residential Tenancy Act  and the Residential Tenancy Regulation require that the landlord <br>pay interest on a security deposit to the tenant upon termination of the t enancy. Option (2) is incorrect because, <br>in commercial tenancies, the return of a security deposit is a personal obligation of the landlord. A purchaser is <br>under no duty to the tenant to repay it. In residential tenancies a security deposit, and the obliga tion of the <br>landlord to repay it (with interest), runs with the land. Therefore, assuming the tenancy continues after the <br>property is transferred, the purchaser will be required to pay these amounts out to the tenant when the tenancy <br>ends. Option (4) is incorrect because O ptions (1) and (2) are incorrect.</p>",Correct Option: 3,616
Which of the following statements about bare land strata developments is TRUE?,"A typical way for a developer to ensure that the houses built within the strata lots have a uniform appearance is through a series of corresponding easement agreements affecting each lot.|Within a bare land strata development, title to the roads is always transferred to the local municipality  on  completion,  so  that  the  municipality  will  be  responsible  for  the  costs  of maintenance and repairs.|Bare land strata developments are typically only used for residential or recreational properties.|The owners of bare land strata lots will be responsible for the costs associated with the common property of the development, which may include outdoor recreational facilities such as lakes or trails.","<p>Option (4) is correct because the owners in a bare land strata development will be responsible for any costs <br>associated with common property. Recreational facilities are frequently built as common property on a bare <br>land strata development. Option (1) is incorrect because uniform appearance is typically ensured through <br>registered building schemes and strata bylaws, rather than easement agreements. Option (2) is incorrect <br>because titl e to the land on which roads are placed can be retained by the strata corporation as common <br>property, such that the owners of the strata lots would be responsible for maintenance and repair. Option (3) is incorrect because bare land strata developments, as ide from being for residential and recreational <br>development, are often also used for industrial and commercial development.</p>",Correct Option: 4,617
Which of the following is/are TRUE regarding listing contracts?,"The purchaser can rely on the terms in the listing contract.|The listing contract must be signed by all persons who have an ownership interest in the property being sold.|If the licensee includes the terms ""approximately"" or ""more or less"" when describing the property, the licensee does not have to perform a title search.|All of the above","<p>Option (2) is correct because, if a property is to be listed and then sold, all persons who have an ownership  <br>interest in the property must agree to the listing. Therefore, it is essential that the listing contract is signed by all <br>of the owners. Option (1) is incorrect because the purchaser is not party to the listing contract, and therefore <br>cannot rely on any o f the terms within it. Option (3) is incorrect because a licensee who does not review the title <br>of the listed property assumes the risk of liability to the purchaser, loss of commission, and disciplinary proceedings if a complaint is registered with the British Columbia Financial Services Authority. This remains <br>true even if the licensee includes terms such as “approximately” or “more or less” when describing a property. <br>Option (4) is incorrect because O ptions (1) and (3) are incorrect.</p>",Correct Option: 2,618
An agent will be personally liable to third parties:,whenever the agent contracts on behalf of a principal.|where the agent fails to disclose that they are an agent.|where the agent has no written authority.|in all of the above circumstances.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because at common law there are three situations where an agent will be personally liable <br>to a third party.

Option (2) is <br>incorrect because cooperative developm ents are not strata developments, and therefore have no corresponding <br>strata plans. Option (3) is incorrect because strata plans are required for all strata developments.

This is because, as <br>opposed to an exclusive listing, an open listing does not prevent the seller from employing a number of other <br>brokerages to represent the seller. Commission is only paid to the brokerage who is the effective cause of the <br>eventual sale.</p>",Correct Option: 4,682
Which of the following will NOT result in the release or expiry of an offer?,"The illiteracy of the offeree|The expiry of a specified time limit in the offer prior to acceptance|A counter-offer by the offeree|Revocation of the offer, communicated to the offeree by the offeror","<p>Option (1) is correct because the general rule is that an illiterate person is bound by a contract that he or she has <br>agreed to, unless he or she did not know the general nature of the contract. Therefore, the illiteracy of the <br>offeree, alone, is insufficient to release an offer. Option (2) is incorrect because an offer expires if it is not <br>accepted within the time limit specified in the offer. Option (3) is incorrect because a counter -offer constitutes a <br>rejection of the original offer. Option (4) is incorrect because the offeror can revok e an offer at any time <br>provided that the offeror communicates the revocation to the offeree prior to acceptance.</p>",Correct Option: 1,683

Option (1) is incorrect as this type of heating system does not provide air circulation or filtration.

Option (2) is incorrect because specific performance is a remedy that was <br>developed by the courts of equity, not enacted via government statute. Option (3) is incorrect because the equity <br>of redemption is a doctrine that was developed by the courts of equity, not enacted via government statue. <br>Option (4) is incorrect because O ptions (2) and (3) are incorrect.</p>",Correct Option: 1,685
Which one of the following is NOT a mortgagor covenant?,"Pay all taxes on the land and on the improvements|Keep the premises in a reasonable state of repair|To convey the property to the mortgagee, at its option, in exchange for an amount equal to current market value|Pay the debt and accrued interest according to the agreed upon schedule","<p>Option (3) is correct because there is a fundamental principle of mortgage law which prohibits “clogging” on “the equity of redemption”. This principle states that the borrower (or the mortgagor) cannot be prevented by <br>the terms of the mortgage from eventually redeeming his or her property free from the conditions contained in <br>the mortgage upon repayment of the loan. An opti on to purchase a mortgaged property given by the borrower <br>to the lender at the time the mortgage is negotiated, if exercised, would prevent the mortgagor from redeeming <br>his or her property upon repayment, and is therefore void. Option (1) is incorrect beca use, in mortgage <br>agreements, mortgagors generally covenant to pay all taxes on land and the improvements. Option (2) is <br>incorrect because it is common for a mortgagor to covenant to keep the land and buildings thereof in “good <br>condition and repair”, thereb y protecting the value of the security (the property). Option (4) is incorrect because <br>the repayment clause of a mortgage agreement will set out the borrower’s promise to pay the debt and accrued interest according to the schedule agreed upon.</p>",Correct Option: 3,686

Option (1) is incorrect  because given that the net operating income <br>remains constant, the market value of the property will decline as the required yield rises. Option (2) is <br>incorrect because the market value of an income -producing property is best determined by the yields that <br>prospective purchasers reasonably expect to earn. Option (3) is incorrect  because net operating income and <br>gross realized income (also known as “ gross realized revenue ” or “gross effective income ”) are different; net <br>operating income is derived by subtracting operating expenses from gross realized income.</p>",Correct Option: 4,687
"Robert asks Whitney to act as his agent at the auction of the effects of a deceased rock star. Robert was an enthusiastic fan of the deceased and tells Whitney that no matter what, he must become the owner of the deceased's vintage Rolls Royce, which is painted in a most attractive paisley motif. Whitney is also told that under no circumstances is she to come away from the auction without buying this automobile for Robert. At the auction, the rock star's paisley Rolls Royce is offered with a second pin-striped version of the vehicle. The two vehicles are offered as a package and accordingly, Whitney as the successful bidder purchases both vehicles for Robert. If asked to discuss Whitney's scope of authority, you would correctly answer that during the course of the fact pattern, Whitney was provided with:",express authority.|implied authority.|both express and implied authority.|neither express nor implied authority.,<p>Option (3) is correct because Robert expressly granted Whitney the authority to purchas e the deceased’s <br>“paisley motif” Rolls Royce by instructing Whitney not to come away from the auction without buying the <br>automobile under any circumstances. These instructions also granted Whitney the implied authority to <br>purchase the second “pin -striped” automobile since purchasing the second automobile was necessary in order <br>to carry out the express instructions (to purchase the “paisley motif” automobile).  Option (4) is incorrect for this <br>reason. Options (1) and (2) are incorrect because they do not describe the full scope of Whitney’s authority.</p>,Correct Option: 3,688

"Three years ago, Larry bought a house, at which time he arranged a mortgage for $240,000. The loan was written at a rate of 5.75% per annum compounded semi-annually, calling for monthly payments of $1,500.05 and an outstanding balance of $214,838.44 due at the end of the 5-year term. Larry has just received an offer from Mary to buy his house. Mary's offer consists of $50,000 cash and assumption of the existing financing for the remainder of the term.

Option (3) is incorrect because the <br>courts have developed the Stack v. Eaton test, a two part test for determining whether an item i s a fixture or a <br>chattel.

In which one of the following mortgage repayment schemes do the monthly mortgage payments increase on a regular basis?,Reverse annuity mortgage|Graduated payment mortgage|Straight line principal reduction mortgage|Interest accruing mortgage,"<p>Option (2) is correct because a  graduated payment mortgage has payments that increase on a regular basis over <br>a specified term. Option (1)  is incorrect because in a reverse annuity mortgage, there is no repayment until the <br>end of the loan term or the death of the borrower; instead, over  the term of the mortgage, the lender advances <br>funds to the borrower. Option (3) is incorrect because in a straight line principal reduction mortgage, the same <br>amount of principal is always paid and the corresponding interest is based on the outstanding ba lance; <br>therefore, the monthly mortgage payments decrease. Option (4) is incorrect because in an interest accruing <br>mortgage, no payments of interest or principal are made during the life of the loan.</p>",Correct Option: 2,705

Option (1) is incorrect because the <br>Interest Act does not require t hat the rate of interest chargeable under a mortgage be “reasonable”, in the <br>prevailing market for funds. The Interest Act  imposes no general cap on mortgage interest rates and states that, <br>except as otherwise provided for by an Act of Parliament, any pers on may charge “any rate of interest…that is <br>agreed on”. Option (2) is incorrect because the Criminal Code defines a criminal rate of interest as an effective <br>annual rate of over 60%, not 50%.

Which of the following does NOT need to be proved?","That the licensee making the statement did so in the course of business.|That the licensee making the statement had a contractual relationship with the person to whom they gave the advice.|That the licensee making the statement did not qualify or disclaim the statement.|That the licensee making the statement knows, or should have known, that the advice was relied upon.","<p>Option (2) is correct because a licensee may be held liable for damages caused by a negligent misstatement <br>made to a person with whom they do not have a contractual relationship. For example, a licensee acting for a <br>seller could be held liable for negligen t misrepresentation for a statement made to a buyer despite having no <br>contractual relationship with the buyer. Options (1) and (4) are incorrect because the special relationship giving <br>rise to a duty to take care (not to make negligent misstatements) will be created where a skilled person, such as a <br>real estate licensee, gives advice in the course of his or her business to a person who is reasonable going to rely on that advice.

If you enter <br>negotiations unprepared to make concessions it is unlikely that the other party will be willing to do so. Option <br>(1) is incorrect because it is important that concessions o ccur in a relatively reciprocal fashion. If one party <br>makes repeated concessions without expecting the other party to follow with similar behaviour, this <br>encourages the latter party to hold tight and not participate in the exchange of resources. Option (2)  is incorrect <br>because considerable research demonstrates that more optimal solutions are reached when parties do not go issue by issue, and instead package and trade multiple issues simultaneously. Option (4) is incorrect because <br>disclosing your underlying  interests will often result in more effective negotiations.

In the circumstances of this question, the law will invoke <br>quantum meruit to imply a promise (given by Joe to Harry) to pay a reasonable about for the delivery of <br>the groceries, even though a specific contract price was not agreed to. Option (1) is incorrect for the same <br>reason. Option (2) is incorrect because the delivery of groceries does not fall within the scope of the Real Estate <br>Services  Act.

Op tion (1) is incorrect because misrepresenting a strata unit as having two bedrooms when <br>it only has one would be considered false and misleading in a material respect. Option (2) is incorrect because <br>section 52 prohibits reckless misrepresentations, and fa lsely advertising a house as having a recently renovated <br>kitchen without first investigating the matter would be considered reckless. This false advertisement would also <br>offend section 74.01, since section 74.01 imposes no requirement that the deceptive pr actices were made <br>knowingly or recklessly.

If the visitor decides to sue the owner and/or building manager, what cause of action will the visitor likely use?",Negligent misrepresentation|Occupier's liability|Breach of fiduciary duty|Nuisance,"<p>Option (2) is correct because the Occupiers Liability Act  imposes a duty on occupiers of premises (in this case, <br>the owner and/or building manager) to take such care as in all the circumstances is reasonable to see that <br>persons coming onto the pr operty (in this case, the visitor) will be reasonably safe. In this scenario, the visitor <br>can argue that this duty was not met because the skylight collapsed, inuring him.

"Akiko Yamada vacated the property she had just sold, taking all her household furniture. Assuming she has taken each of the following items, which item(s) must Akiko replace? (Assume that none of the following items have been dealt with specifically in the contract of purchase and sale.)","A small Persian throw rug from the front hall, which had been chosen especially to complement the colours in the marble on the floor|An antique, stained glass window, which was hung on two large hooks in front of the living room window|Wall-to-wall carpeting from the den, which had been attached to a tack strip that, in turn, was attached to the hardwood floor|Akiko must replace all of the above three items.","<p>Option (3) is correct because the wall -to-wall carpeting that Akiko removed is most likely a fixture, and <br>therefore was included in the purchase price (i.e., should have remained with the property when it was sold). <br>Per Stack v. T. Eaton Co. , articles affixed to the land even slightly –  as the wall -to-wall carpeting is –  are <br>presumed to be part of the land. The purpose of affixing the carpeting was most likely to improve the den; <br>therefore, the presumption that the carpeting is a fixture is unlikely to be overturned. Option (1) is incorrect <br>because a throw rug is not attached to the land (except by its own weight), and therefore is presumed to be a <br>chattel. Unless stipulated in the contract of purchase and sale, chattels are excluded from the purchase price of <br>real property. Option (2) is incorrect because the stained glass window is most likely a chattel. The stained glass <br>window, being attached (via hooks), will initially be presumed a fixture (per Stack v. T . Eaton Co. ). However, this <br>presum ption is easily overturned. The window is affixed only slightly, being hung on two hooks, and therefore <br>is quite easily removed. Additionally, since the antique window is merely hung in front of the living room window, it serves no apparent structural function. Therefore, the purpose of affixing the stained glass window <br>is most likely to better enjoy the window as a decorative piece (similar to a painting), rather than to improve the <br>land.</p>",Correct Option: 3,724
"An acquaintance of yours has approached you and wants to know why the bank that may finance his purchase of a house requires an appraisal. He claims that since an appraisal is not required for an investment in stocks, an appraisal should not be required for an investment in real property. Which of the following statements provides the BEST reasoning for your support of the bank's requirement?",The high turnover of real estate relative to stocks means that only an expert can keep up with changing values.|The local nature of the real estate market implies that the flow of information will be unlimited and easy to assemble.|It is difficult to find real properties that are very much alike.|Real estate purchase decisions are generally less significant than decisions regarding an individual share purchase.,"<p>Option (3) is the correct answer. Appraisals are required to determine the value of real property because it is <br>difficult to find properties that are very much alike. Unlike real property, other financial assets such as stocks <br>are more homogenous and will have an explicitly determined price. O ptions  (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 3,725
Which of the following is the MOST common type of construction today for high-rise apartment buildings?,Wood stud frame|Steel studs and concrete topping|Concrete framing|Masonry walls and wood floors,"<p>Option (3) is correct because concrete framing is the most common type of construction today for high- rise <br>apartment buildings. This is because most high- rise residential buildings normally require a two -hour <br>fire-rating for floors and columns and concrete will achieve this rating without any additional protection for <br>most applications.  Options (1), (2), and (4) are incorrect.</p>",Correct Option: 3,726
"Under the Strata Property Act, strata corporations are obligated to do certain things. Which of the following is NOT a duty the strata corporation is obliged to carry out?",The maintenance of property insurance on the common property|The creation of an operating fund for common expenses|The performance of work ordered by a competent public authority in respect of a strata lot|The establishment of a contingency reserve fund,<p>Option (3) is correct because it is the owner’s responsibility to comply with work orders from public authorities <br>in respect of a strata lot. This is why section 85 of the  Strata Corporation Act  requires owners to reimburse the <br>strata corporation for the cost of w ork done by the strata corporation following the owner’s failure to comply <br>with a work order from a public or local authority under section 85 of the Act. Option (1) is incorrect because <br>the Strata Property Act  requires the strata corporation to obtain and  maintain full -replacement -value property <br>insurance against harm to the common property. Option (2) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act <br>requires every strata corporation to have an operating fund for common expenses that usually occur one or <br>more times each year. Option (4) is incorrect because the Strata Property Act  requires every strata corporation <br>to establish a contingency reserve fund for expenses that usually occur less often than once a year or that do not <br>usually occur.</p>,Correct Option: 3,727
"Deborah is a trading services licensee. After providing her best estimate with respect to the value of Susan's property, Deborah lists the property at $600,000. Jennifer, who has learned that Susan's property is situated in the middle of an area to be redeveloped, immediately comes to Deborah with a full-price, subject-free, offer. In response to Deborah's surprise reaction to the offer, Jennifer acknowledges that a redevelopment of the area is intended. Deborah does not advise Susan of the redevelopment as it might jeopardize the deal and, in any event, she feels that a redevelopment might cause the value of Susan's property to decrease rather than rise. Susan accepts Jennifer's offer and is delighted that the property sold so quickly. Which of the following statements is TRUE?","Susan does not have any claim against Deborah because she received the full listing price for her property.|If Deborah had advised Susan of the redevelopment, she would have breached the duty that she owed to Jennifer.|The proposed redevelopment might have affected Susan's decision to sell her property and therefore, should have been brought to Susan's attention.|As long as Deborah honestly believed that the offer was fair, she has satisfied her duty to Susan.","<p>Option (3) is correct because Deborah, as Susan’s agent, owed Susan a duty to make complete disclosure of <br>everything relevant to the transaction within Deborah’s knowledge. Regardless of whether or not Deborah <br>thought that the redevelopment would  increase or decrease the value of the property, Deborah had a duty to <br>advise Susan of the redevelopment because it might in some way have affected Susan’s decision. Option (4) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (1) is incorrect because, where an age nt has breached any duties to the <br>principal, which Deborah has done, the agent’s right to commission will probably be lost. Therefore, Susan likely does have a claim against Deborah for the commission paid to Susan. In addition, Susan may have a <br>potential claim against Deborah if she can prove that the property could have been sold for more had Deborah <br>advised her of the redevelopment. Option (2) is incorrect because, in this scenario, Deborah did not owe a duty <br>to Jennifer (a third party) not to advise Sus an of the redevelopment.</p>",Correct Option: 3,728
The Local Government Act creates three different levels of local law. Which of the following is NOT one of these levels of local law?,Local improvement district|Local enterprise zone|Regional district|Municipality,"<p>Option (2) is correct because local enterprise zones are not a level of local law created under the Local <br>Government Act .

"Luke and Alan are co-owners of a property, as tenants in common. They signed an agreement that stated that if either party wanted to sell their interest, the other party would have a right of first refusal to purchase the other party's interest. Alan discovers that Luke has entered into a contract to sell his interest, without offering Alan an opportunity to purchase the property, as previously agreed. What should Alan do at this time?",Alan should a file a Certificate of Pending Litigation on the property.|Alan should register a caveat on the property.|Alan should register a judgment on the property.|Alan should hire a bailiff to take possession of the property.,"<p>Option (2) is correct because Alan should register a caveat, which will prevent the transfer of the property, and <br>stay on the register for two months. This will give Alan time to commence a court action, if he so chooses. <br>Option  (1) is incorrect because Luke is not yet able to file a Certificate of Pending Litigation, because a court <br>action has not yet been commenced. Option (3) is incorrect because Alan has not yet obtained a judgment <br>against Luke, and thus is not able to regist er a judgment. Option (4) is incorrect because Alan has not obtained <br>an Order of Possession, and thus is not yet entitled to hire a bailiff.   <br></p>",Correct Option: 2,730
"Vanna has agreed to sell her cottage to Pat. Vanna and Pat used a standard contract of purchase and sale, in which they agreed to the following dates: Completion Date:  August 31, 2018 Adjustment Date:  January 1, 2019 Based on this information, which of the following statements is TRUE?",There will be no adjustment for property taxes on the buyer's statement of adjustments.|The property taxes will appear as a credit on the buyer's statement of adjustments.|The property taxes will appear as a credit on the seller's statement of adjustments.|The property taxes will appear as a debit on the seller's statement of adjustments.,"<p>Option (1) is correct because the buyer in a real estate transaction assumes responsibility for the taxes from the <br>adjustment date onwards. Since Pat is assuming responsibility for the taxes on January 1, the first day of the <br>year, no adjustment is necessary. Remember that property taxes are paid for a calendar year, even though th ey <br>are usually due on July 1. Options (2), (3), and (4) are incorrect, because no adjustment is necessary for property <br>taxes in this scenario, and therefore property taxes will not appear as a debit or credit on either the buyer’s or <br>seller’s statement of adjustments.</p>",Correct Option: 1,731
"In the context of appraisal, which one of the following properties is MOST likely to possess latent value?",A 30-acre dairy farm in the Agricultural Land Reserve|A recently constructed duplex unit in a single-family residential area of the city|A bicycle store that is built on land zoned for commercial use|A farmhouse situated on land zoned for commercial use,"<p>Option (4) is the correct answer (and Options (1), (2), and (3) are incorrect) as the farmhouse sit uated on land <br>zoned for commercial use is likely to be the only option that has redevelopment potential.</p>",Correct Option: 4,732
"In the comparative approach of appraisal, one method of making final adjustments to price is to use a rating grid. In using a rating grid, it is MOST important that:",the subject property be the basis of comparison and all comparables be adjusted to it.|the final market value be determined by averaging the comparable sale prices (after adjustments).|the comparable properties have the same square footage of improvements as the subject property.|the comparable properties have the same lot size as the subject property.,"<p>Option (1) is correct because w hen using a rating grid, the subject property is the standard of comparison and <br>each comparable sale is adjusted to it. The subject property is not adjusted to the comparables nor are the <br>comparables adjusted to each o ther.  Option ( 2) is incorrect because the correct approach is to determine which <br>comparable is most like the subject property and use that as main evidence for the final market value, not to average the value of the comparable sale prices.  Option (3) is in correct because the comparable properties do <br>not require the same square footage of improvements as the subject property.

"A young executive has applied to her bank for a mortgage loan to enable her to purchase a house. Her income is $55,000 per year. The bank informs her they will apply a 32% gross debt service ratio when calculating her maximum loan, and that current mortgage rates are 2.95% per annum, compounded semi-annually for 20-year amortization mortgages. The government-specified qualifying rate is 5.25% per annum, compounded semi-annually. Annual property taxes are $2,000 and mortgage payments are to be made monthly.

As in the example above, increasing the amortization period will increase the OSB at time 24. 
Therefore, Option (2) is correct. Your payments have decreased and you are stretching out the time needed to pay off the loan. 
You are paying more interest, and since interest is paid more at the beginning than at the end of the loan, 
your payments on principal are delayed; therefore, at each point in time, the amount outstanding on your principal will be greater.

"An investor has decided to establish a bank account in order to accumulate sufficient capital at the end of seven years to purchase a boat.

 To solve this problem, first convert the nominal interest rate, compounded monthly, to an annual effective rate
  so that the frequency of compounding matches the frequency of the payments. Since there is no payment being
  made today, there is no present value in this calculation. Then, enter the payments of $8,000 and compute the
  future value that would be available at the end of seven years.

"A mortgage for $350,000 is written at 6% per annum, compounded monthly. The mortgage calls for monthly payments, a 5-year term, and a 25-year amortization. The mortgage contract permits the borrower to prepay the full amount of the loan at any time subject to the payment of a penalty, which is the greater of a three months' interest penalty or the interest rate differential. Payments are rounded up to the next higher dollar. At the time of prepayment, the current comparable interest rate is 4% per annum, compounded monthly. If the borrower wishes to prepay this loan at the end of the first year (with the 12th payment), calculate the amount of the payout penalty.","$5,624.87|$5,156.37|$27,500.66|$34,621.75","<table border=""1"" cellpadding=""6"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""border-collapse:collapse;width:100%;font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;margin-bottom:15px;"">

"A developer is offering a mortgage loan of $102,000 at 9.25% per annum, compounded semi-annually, on each of 16 units in a condominium development. The mortgages have monthly payments, 5-year terms, and 20-year amortization periods. Each unit is priced at $132,000 and the units have been selling over the past seven months. Even with a recent decrease in interest rates (currently at j  = 8%), the property has 2 attracted the attention of a buyer who has made a full price offer, and applied for the developer's financing on one of the condominium units. The market value of the offer, rounded to the nearest dollar is:","$136,835|$115,224|$130,000|$106,300","<p>
 The first step for this question is to calculate the monthly payment and outstanding balance owing at the end of
 the 5 -year term based on the contract interest rate; the second step is to calculate the market value of the
 mortgage based on the market rate;  the final step is to calculate the market value of the offer. Since each unit is
 priced at $132,000 and the mortgage loan is for $102,000, the down payment is $30,000. To calculate the market
 value of the offer, add the cash down payment to the market value of the mortgage.

Based on the limited information indicated by the sale comparables, which of the following is the most accurate market value range for Property C, rounded to the nearest $1,000?
</p>","\$210,000 to \$220,000|\$229,000 to \$252,000|\$217,000 to \$228,000|\$299,000 to \$327,000","<style>

</style>

<p>For this question, use the following three formulas:</p>

<p>
  Market Value =
  <span class=""frac"">
    <span class=""top"">NOI</span>
    <span class=""bot"">Cap Rate</span>
  </span>
</p>

<p>
  Cap Rate =
  <span class=""frac"">
    <span class=""top"">NOI</span>
    <span class=""bot"">Market Value</span>
  </span>
</p>

<p>NOI = Gross Potential Income − Vacancy − Current Operating Expenses</p>

<p>Calculate the NOI for each of the three properties and the cap rate for the two comparable properties.</p>

<p><b>Comparable A:</b><br>
NOI = $45,000 − $4,500 − $30,000 = $10,500<br>
Cap Rate = $10,500 ÷ $210,000 = 0.05
</p>

<p><b>Comparable B:</b><br>
NOI = $49,000 − $4,900 − $32,000 = $12,100<br>
Cap Rate = $12,100 ÷ $220,000 = 0.055
</p>

<p>
The cap rate used to calculate the market value of the subject property is the one that most reflects the subject property and is determined by several factors. For the purposes of this question, the two most comparable properties have been selected and a range of values is determined.
</p>

<p><b>Subject Property: NOI = $54,000 − $5,400 − $36,000 = $12,600</b></p>

<p><b>Market value using cap rate from Comparable A:</b><br>
Market Value = $12,600 ÷ 0.05 = $252,000
</p>

<p><b>Market value using cap rate from Comparable B:</b><br>
Market Value = $12,600 ÷ 0.055 = $229,090.91 or $229,000 (rounded)

<p>
The subject property’s market value estimate is in the range of $229,000 to $252,000, (rounded to the nearest $1,000).

To calculate the maximum loan amount, calculate the loan amounts based on both the constraint of the loan-to-value ratio and the gross debt service ratio. 
The loan-to-value is calculated based on the bank’s appraisal of the property. In this case, the amount the bank appraises the property at is $375,000. 
Once the payments from the GDSR are calculated, the PV of the loan is calculated, taking into consideration the stress test qualification rules. 
The loan amount that satisfies both constraints (the smaller amount) will be the maximum loan amount.

The mortgage qualifying rate is based on the greater of (1) the government-specified qualifying rate of j₂ = 5.25% OR (2) an additional 2% above the mortgage’s negotiated contract rate. 
In this case, you would apply a rate of j₂ = 5.25%, the government-specified rate, which is greater than the mortgage’s contract rate plus 2% of j₂ = 5% (2% + 3%).

<p>
The yield to the lender is below the loan’s interest rate (<i>j₂ = 4.5%</i>), which is expected since the 
payments are sufficient to pay off a $250,000 loan, but the lender is actually advancing $255,000 
(2% × $250,000 + $250,000). 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the lender is being slightly underpaid with each payment. Given the inverse relationship between interest rates and present value, if the present value rises, then the interest rate drops.

"Mimi was house-sitting for her friends Tom and Lizzie while they were on a three month photo-safari in Africa. The front porch was damaged in a freak storm that caused a tree to fall and smash the bottom two steps. Mimi didn't have the money to hire a carpenter to repair the stairs, so she attached a large sign to the bottom of the steps reading, ""DANGER KEEP OFF"". Dave, an out of work handyman who could not read English, was walking from house to house in the neighbourhood looking for casual work. He entered Tom and Lizzie's property, and not understanding the sign started up the steps to the front door. Dave landed on the damaged step, and the weight of his body was more than the step could stand. He broke his leg in two places, and having no insurance, has run up $3,750 in medical bills. Dave now intends to begin a lawsuit. Which of the following statements is FALSE?","Under the Occupiers Liability Act, both Mimi and the absent owners qualify as ""occupiers.""|Dave will be unsuccessful in his lawsuit because he willingly accepted the risk of injury when he walked up the broken steps.|The duty of care owed by an occupier under the Occupiers Liability Act applies in relation to the condition of the premises, activities on the premises, or the conduct of third parties on the premises.|A court will consider the reasonableness of the occupier's actions in order to establish liability in this case.","<p>Option (2) is correct because Dave is not trespassing while committing or intending to commit a criminal act  (as <br>he was merely looking for casual work).

Option (1) is incorrect because Mimi is an occupier since she is in “physical possession <br>of the premises”, and the absent owners remain occupiers because they still have “responsibility for, and control over” the property. (There may be more than one occupi er of the same premises as per section 1 of the <br>Occupiers Liability Act. ) Option (3) is incorrect because section 3(2) of the Occupier s Liability Act  states that the <br>duty of care imposed on occupiers applies in relation to the: (a) condition of the premise s; (b) activities on the <br>premises; or (c) conduct of third parties on the premises. Option (4) is incorrect because the duty of care <br>imposed by the Occupiers Liability Act  on an occupier is to take such care as in all the circumstances is <br>reasonable to see  that persons coming onto the property will be reasonably safe.  <br></p>",Correct Option: 2,999
